Although the property displayed the AAA emblem, it certainly left a lot to be desired. There were chips & scrapes on the bottom of the door frame in the bathroom and the lotion containers were half full--apparently not replaced by housekeeping. We needed an early wakeup call, but couldn't use the clock radio alarm as there wasn't a radio in the room. There was no TV channel listing on the remote, or on the TV menu making viewing a chore.The TV remote had to be returned when checking-out.

Asked front desk for a local Seattle restaurant on my first night. She suggested two cookie-cutter wine bars and a mall restaurant. Not a big deal, but as I became familiar with downtown Seattle, I couldn't believe she didn't recommend The Brooklyn or one of the many other restaurants with true local flavor.

The air conditioner did not work and the heater was on and could not be turned off or adjusted. Althought it was cold outside we felt we were in a sauna and had to open the windows for air. We were told by the staff that at a certain temperature outside the air would not turn on and the heater would go on automatically.

The hotel is beautiful, very modern, stylish, with attention to detail. Our room on the -th floor was spacious, with great decor, hardwood floors, Keurig coffee maker, and floor to ceiling windows.
The bathroom was also big with a large shower. There was no tub, which was fine with us.
One of the best things - a QUIET air-conditioner! Finally something that didn't wake me up at night. Overall, the room was very quite despite the fact that there were occupied rooms all around us.
The staff was very pleasant. We asked if we could have a late check out at - pm. The gentleman at the desk graciously offered us - pm checkout due to our platinum status. It was perfect!
The restaurant downstairs in the lobby was nice, but doesn't really have much selection for lunch. The upstairs patio bar on the -th floor was closed for renovation.
The location is great. Within walking distance to Balboa Park (you can grab a free trolley once in the park), Seaport Village and of course Gaslamp.

I had a room on the --th floor. It was spooky. The --th floor is only half a floor, rooms on one side of the hall, the other side of the hall is roof. The hallway temperature was in the mid --'s. The building moaned with mechanical sounds coming, seemingly, from everywhere. More than once I was reminded of the movie Barton Fink. Ice machines are located on floors -, -, and -, however all of them were out of order. Ice was available in the lobby. 
The door from the garage to the hotel was un-locked at all times. See a previous review about the door being """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""broken"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The garage itself seemed dirty and dingy.

We had a room with a king bed, there was - of us, so I asked for a rollaway bed, $--- night.

What I considered a ripoff however was the $--- day we had to pay for internet, when these days most places now offer it for free. Not only that, but it was only good for one device! We had two laptops, so only one could access the internet on any given day.
They say the room comes with DVD player, well you have to ask for one, because they are not in the room. Also, the tvs are very old. I asked for a DVD player - different days before I got one, they have a limited number. There is no ice machine, and the vending machines are only on the ground floor. I called twice to get an extra pillow and gave up, never got one. We got two face cloths the first couple of days, one the -rd day, then none for the remainder of our stay. I didn't bother calling them after my other attempts. I just used their towels to wash my face.
And finally, I asked for a wake up call for the morning we were leaving for the airport, I was right in front of the guy at reception when I asked and saw him write it down. Thankfully I woke up on my own because they never called. So again I don't know if we were treated poorly because we were in a discounted room, or that's just the way they are.

After some research on Tripadvisor i had high expectations for this property and i was not disappointed. Only thing disappointing was that we did not spend a lot of time in the hotel. We had a - bedroom apartment and it was beautifully appointed with good size rooms, proper kitchen and laundry which was great, especially as we had been traveling in Hawaii for a week prior to SF and was then heading off to Ski Fields. 
The apartment was very clean and well looked after. 
Good location if your wanting to do the Tourist things near Fishermans Wharf. Take a tour of Alcatraz, the concierge got us tickets for the tour. If your wanting to do shopping then Union Square is the place to go. We took a taxi, the hotel has one courtesty car, however was not available for when we needed it, so we took a taxi for $-- each way. 
Breakfast was great, however for the price of the hotel, you would expect a full hot breakfast, the breakfast provided was continental, i did enjoy the fresh raspberries and blueberries on offer.

Most of the people in our group were children. The staff welcomed us (Thank you Gio) allowed us to eat breakfast and crash in the lobby until our rooms were ready. They got all of us in quickly and when our suite wasn't ready they gave us two standard rooms so we would have plenty of room for our family to be comfortable, at no extra charge. The location was great, right across from the Garden home of the Bruins, and we were there when they won the Stanley cup. Even though the game was in Canada the area was packed with excitment. We were excited to be a part of it all and became Bruins fans!
The Boston police did an excellent job of keeping everything under control. The hotel did an excellent job of handling the extra traffic and chaos too. The manger, Jamie, was very nice and gave ice cream and candy treats to the kids. The area did not seem bad to me at all. There are a lot of pubs in the area, but there seem to be alot of pubs all over Boston.

The lobby was lovely and the desk staff very helpful, professional and friendly. The beds were comfortable with clean sheets and plenty of pillows.
The Bad: The rooms were indeed small. The bathrooms were snazzy with marble tile floors and pedestal sinks BUT there was no place to put ANYTHING - including your toothbrush and even shampoo. Perhaps adding a shelf beside the mirror would help. It was a hassle to have to have to constantly unpack your toiletries for every single use. Also, the Wi-Fi connection in the lobby was spotty and did not work in the room at all despite my willingness to pay the daily fee, a real problem if you need to do work. 
The Ugly: The room was never cleaned. When we first checked in, I found beer caps on the window sills. The second day, I came back to find a giant wad of used towels on the floor next to the bed - not all of them ours! The third day, I returned to find the contents of the coffee maker soaking the table top. And on each day, the maids showed up at -AM. Once, they actually walked in while we were still sleeping?!? 
And a word to the wise, get there early for check in because the Inn “routinely overbooks.” We watched two people get turned away despite having reservations. Good luck finding another room during convention season.

Although I have been called a snob, I like to think I have a taste for the finer things in life, and have a healthy discrimination against hotels that cost an arm and a leg, but do not deliver. On the other hand, I have a special appreciation for a place that lives up to its expectations. The Royal Palms in Phoenix is such a place. From the minute we pulled up in our rental car, till we pulled away four days later, we were treated as VIPs. You can tell the staff at the Royal Palms enjoy working there because they always have a smile on their face, and they never give you the begrudging response I have received at other hotels when asking for this or that. The pool is immaculate, pool bartendars fun and energetic, great workout facility, great location, incredible food, and fantastic spa. I loved my room and did not want to leave.

The receptionist offered me ear plugs! I suspect we were kept on the bottom floor because we had the Travelzoo special rate for - nights. The bottom floor, which is actually the second floor, is very noisy from traffic on the Bowery. The trucks even shake the hotel.

All this means we slept very poorly. The room itself is nice enough, large, clean, and new. The hotel is a block from the subway, which is very convenient. The continental breakfast is unimpressive. The hotel was a good deal with the Travelzoo special rate, but I wouldn't stay here again at the regular rate.",Firefox,Mobile

In addition to the stylish comfort of the room, I especially appreciated the little amenities that seem to have evaporated elsewhere, even at fairly pricey hotels: free fitness center and pool, free bottled water, real cream with the in-room coffee set-up, a mini-fridge that is not an electronically monitored mini-bar, and free wireless internet--one that doesn't even require entering a long code in order to access.

So to enjoy the DC area we booked the hotel by naming our price on Priceline. We ended up booking a $--- rate! Trying to book on the Crowne Plaza website, they are demanding $---+, which all value is lost for that amount. 
It is older, which means everything is smaller, but still it is a beautiful hotel. The service was top notch through out minus the belle service.

The front desk agent upgraded our room view to look over the park and Washington Monument. He also told us a little bit about the area. The concierge was very friendly and graciously helped us out on dinner reservations one night. 
The rooms is somewhat tight but not too bad. The rooms are well appointed with iPod dock, safe and black out curtains. The bathroom is extremely tight. It's not possible for two to get ready in their bathrooms, even thought it is smartly designed, still too small. 
The Hamilton has a great bar just off the lobby with a few TVs to catch the games. There is also a Starbucks attached for those that need their daily fix. This location is a busy one on weekdays.

I had a very comfortable king-size bed, plus a desk, desk-chair, comfortable chair for reading, flat-screen television, free wi-fi, air conditioner, and the best lighting I have ever had in a hotel. The bathroom was small but clean. The room looked out into a courtyard and was very quiet.

id80225,"We have patronized a number of Joie de Vivre hotels and this is the most upscale, with a full service restaurant.
The building itself looks a little incongruous being in a cylindrical configuration and is in somewhat of a no man's land. However, it is well served for road access being next door to entry and exit ramps for I--- (there is construction at the interchange which effects traffic patterns, and one ramp is closed at nights).
The room was above average size with a comfortable king bed, work desk, full length closet and a mini bar - refrigerator. There was both WiFi and Ethernet complimentary broadband access in the room; the WiFi was satisfactory but I couldn't get the Ethernet to connect. The desk surface was large enough to be able to work comfortably on. Although there were numerous power outlets in the room few of them were convenient to the desk. There was only one useful outlet close to the desk, near the floor. Under the desk there was an additional outlet but hidden behind a rats nest of communication wiring. We ended up with devices on the bedside table and in the bathroom in order to charge them.
The bathroom was large with a single sink, toilet and shower. The shower was a walk-in type and looked as if it could have been converted from a tub configuration. Water pressure and temperature was good. Lighting was fluorescent but was adequate.
The room provided an ironing board and iron, a safe (which I didn't' use), hair dryer and a coffee maker. The room overlooked I---, noise from which was discernible at night but not uncomfortably so. The air conditioning unit was more obtrusive, largely I think because I don't travel much any longer and so I'm unused to an AC unit.
The staff were accommodating, pleasant and efficient, Parking is complimentary but requires the use of a valet service, we never waited more than two minutes for our car.
Unlike other Joie de Vivre hotels we have stayed in breakfast is not complimentary. One can either use the restaurant or they have a cafe with muffins and croissants. We didn't partake of breakfast at the hotel so I cannot comment, although the cafe offerings didn't look particularly inspiring. We eat dinner at the hotel one night and it was excellent, much better than usual hotel restaurant fare and it was reasonably priced. Another surprise was that it was busy.
Although the hotel is somewhat isolated from services such as shops and restaurants, Brentwood Village is -.- miles down Sunset Blvd. and there is a sidewalk between the hotel and the village for anyone wanting a little exercise. In the village there is an excellent restaurant (Divino) and a cafe (Lu Pan Quotidian), also excellent and both worth visiting.

The area around the Marriott leaves much to be desired. Just a few restaurants down the street, and not much night-life to speak of. Just walking the block or so to get to a nearby brewery did not feel totally safe. There's a different vibe during the day and conveniently, there is a Metro stop not half a block up the street for ease of getting around D.C.

id80248,"While I live in SoCal now, I am a NorCal native and long-time resident. My partner and I decided to stay in the city for her birthday, and I wanted to find a hotel that wasn't the standard cookie-cutter major-chain type (although I am a rewards member of many). I don't even remember how I landed on the Hotel Vitale site, but I was instantly hooked. Reason: The Ferry Building. If you are a foodie, you KNOW already you're going to SF, you KNOW where you want to be on a Saturday morning, and this hotel is right across the street, poised in perfect striking distance. So I browsed the site, and was amazed that this little hidden gem was to be found. I booked one of the better rooms with a TERRIFIC view (room ---) and spa shower, and took the plunge with an open mind and high hopes.
The Hotel Vitale did not disappoint. From the moment we got there, the modern elegance of the property was wonderful. My partner was a little recalcitrant at first (as she put it, she could not think of a hotel that, on first sight, was LESS """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""her type"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""") but when we got to the room... 
I had advised the hotel that it was my partner's birthday. When we got in (very late Fri night), there awaited a bottle of champagne on ice...and not Cook's or something cheap, either! It was a very impressive bottle of Chandon Brut. accompanied by a personalized card for me from the manager, as well as a personalized card for my partner (from the housekeeping staff at turndown). 
We were worried about the minbar, because we intended to purchase food at the farmer's market-Ferry Building on Sat, and nosh on it throughout the weekend. Not to worry -- the minibar was NOT one of those electronic-sensor ones that charges your room if you just breathe on something...we were able to remove items to make room for our purchases, and then replace them when we were done. Housekeeping seemed to dig this immediately, as nothing was moved or touched in that regard. 
We ended up purchasing a lot of nibbles at the farmer's market- ferry building, and spent one night watching in-room movies while having a luxurious feast in a room that did it justice. 
These superior rooms do have a closet type armoire with a couple of drawers, as well as a small curtained off area for the ironing board and iron. The closet included two robes, and two COMPLIMENTARY pairs of slippers. Our bellman quickly rustled up two additional suitcase racks and set them up, so space was not a problem. The window-seat couch had a cashmere throw, and the bedding --- well, it was the best sleep of our lives, and I didn't want to leave... We received a card inviting us to a free yoga session if we so desired. 
There are complimentary """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Fresh"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" toiletries as well as overpriced 'honor bar' ones, which didn't impress us enough to try them. The in-room honor bar also includes Dean & Deluca treats, Scharffenberger chocolates, airplane booze, etc., and a clever """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""intimacy kit"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" package of *ahem* items in case you forgot something... They will give you either the NY Times, SF Chronicle or both, if you just ask. The papers arrive in a clever canvas sack hanging on your door daily. 
If you're worried about clanging maid carts or ice machines, forget it. This hotel is very retro euro-styled, in that you call down to the front desk for ice. The hotel is QUIET. We were overlooking the Embarcadero, right over the outdoor bar area, and noise never bothered us even late-night. We WERE able to open our windows to some degree.
The concierge was wonderful. If you ask, he will give you a canvas hotel logo shopping bag for your purchases at the ferry building. Something people haven't mentioned -- go around the back corner from the hotel bar, and you're at an F-line trolley stop, which gets you on board before the huddled masses at the Embarcadero-Ferry building sites. So if you are using the F-line, it is literally door-to-door service, you need to walk maybe --- block. 
We did not dine at Americano, but enjoyed several drinks outdoors. We did not use the spa, but the rooftop space looks wonderful. 
This hotel is not by any real means kid-friendly in and of itself, but they do have a nice kid's program for family travelers called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Kids are VIP"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", where the child will have a personalized ID card on a lanyard given to him-her on check-in, and the child is the one who handles all the check-in procedures, and they will make a kid feel special and important. 
I think the ONLY con about this hotel is that there are no bathtubs in the super-deluxe view rooms (you have to go to the highest-end room for that). I am a shower fiend (and the spa shower is GREAT but can be slippery after product use-- they do not have stall mats) and was quite happy with the rainforest-style shower.

DECOR: This hotel is done in an understated traditional style with Asian influences and antiques. I really like the hotel's style. I disagree with other reviewers that this hotel is dated. I think of it as well preserved and in my opinion, in a very good and charming way. It's like going to my rich aunt's house in the ----'s. The furnishings are, at first glance, not remarkable. Upon further inspection, however, you're forced to admit that while not flashy, everything is tastefully done and of high quality. 
ROOM: I had deluxe bay view room one night and an executive king room the last two nights. Both rooms were wonderful. I'm not sure I'd pay the additional cost for the executive king, though. It did have a very comfortable couch, however. I love the featherbeds placed over the mattress - - great sleeping and lounging. Oh, the down pillows and duvet were very comfortable. I like the color scheme: teal carpet, cream walls, blue upholstery, crystal lamps, floral drapes, and Asian accents. My room was spacious, quiet, clean, and comfortable. I also liked the marble bathroom. It had a large vanity and closet. The airconditioning worked very well and kept my room comfortable.
SERVICE: Very good. Staff here is not as friendly as some of the other hotels I stay at, but they're never rude and are always helpful.
FITNESS CENTER: The hotel has a nice fitness center with great equipment. Most of the machines have individual TVs on them although I don't think headphones are provided - - so bring your own.
LOCATION: Wonderful location atop Nob Hill. Your within easy walking distance to Union Square, China Town, North Beach, and Russian Hill. The location affords some rooms outstanding views of downtown, Coit Tower, and the bay.

Our meeting took place on the second floor in the conference rooms. During a morning break I found a homeless person asleep in one of the stalls in the ladies room. I called the front desk and they escorted him out. There are stairs from the main lobby that anyone could take to get up to the second floor. The elevators require a room key to go higher than floor -. 
One of the nights we were there my colleagues were disturbed by hotel guests in the next room that were ingaging in loud adult relations. It was so loud my colleagues had to call the front desk to ask them to contact the room and tell them to be quiet. 
When we returned to our rooms one day after our meeting my manager's door was left open (by the maids?) with the door stop. Thankfully nothing was taken.
All in all it is a nice hotel. The food at BANK was excellent. We dined there for breakfast & lunch and were very impressed. The hotel bar used to be a Whiskey Bar, but the investors pulled out and now its just know as the Icon Bar. Its a nice bar but I think the cocktail waitresses outfits are a little bit sleazy.

The customer service has always been excellent. Check-in is friendly and efficient. The concierge and doorman are always helpful and friendly.
The rooms have always been very clean and in great condition. They are well-appointed. The bathrooms are nice and the bed plush and comfortable. 
If you can afford to upgrade to a river view, not only will you be rewarded with amazing views, but you'll be buffered from the noise of the trains (The L) that run right behind the hotel. The closer you are to the ground and the rear of the hotel, the more disruptive the noise, at least in our experience.

Cons: Parking is $-- a day, but I used priceline and the hotel cost me $-- all in per day. The location is on the Riverwalk, but Lexington Ave is the furthest Northern hotel still considered Riverwalk, so this could inconvenience those that stay out late or those out of shape.

id80265,"We held our wedding here last year. It is such a beautiful place to have a wedding. The pictures you see on their website are real--the function rooms really look like that, beautiful, opulent, like a fairy tale. We had an hors d'oeuvres reception in the Venetian room, which then opened into the Oval room, where we had dinner. We took pictures in their grand lobby, and most of the guests stayed at the hotel as well, as they offered us very good rates (almost --- the usual rate). Another friend got married at the Grand Ballroom, which is like a scene out of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Beauty and the Beast"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", but the room was far too big for us.
The food was good at the wedding, and the service was excellent. We asked them to raise the temperature of the room (b-c it was January), so everyone (mostly from out of state-country) was warm and cosy. The wedding coordinator was OK--she did everything we asked her to, and didn't miss anything, but she was so difficult to contact while we were planning the wedding. It seems she is overworked and has too many weddings-events to coordinate, but the least we expect from a wedding coordinator is that she reply to emails in a timely manner, which she does not.
We stayed at a suite, which was grand, large, and very comfortable. I especially like the large closets, the fluffy bathrobes, slippers, and the good quality soaps and shampoos (with cotton balls, and all amenities) in the bathroom. All the other guests seemed to enjoy their room too. 
For tourists, this hotel is centrally located in the heart of Boston, and is walking distance to lots of food, shopping, and sights. It's also right near a T stop (public transportation).

Here are the facts, feel free to make your own conclusions:
-. Check-in involved an uncomfortable ---minute interrogation with the manager about why I was in town and what I was planning on doing in the room. Even though it wasn't his business, I told him I was 'in town for the beach' and 'sleeping in the room'. 
-. The hotel lacked the proper billing paperwork from Expedia. Even though they had my reservation, they messed up the billing with Expedia and threatened to charge me again for the room if they couldn't work it out (i.e. punishing me for their own incompetence). Luckily, Expedia was helpful with this and the matter eventually got resolved.
-. A friend from La Jolla showed up to hang out with us at the beach during the day, and the manager yelled at me as we walked by the office because he saw - people although I only booked a room for -. Again, even though it was none of his business, I explained that our friend was just meeting us there and we were on our way to the beach.

The hotel offers a free shuttle that we only used once when the weather turned cold and windy for one day. Our driver was courteous and friendly as was the entire staff.

I don't get that about the people posting reviews on here about hotels. They come visit a city and spend most of the time complaining about how the paint was chipped in the corner by the door, WHO CARES??!. Anyway, we had a flat screen tv, which we watched a couple times, but like I said, we spent most of the time exploring the city. The room was a little bit too dim, but that didn't bother us much. The bathroom was a good size and we had everything we needed. The room was cleaned everyday and everyone was so helpful and friendly! Th beds were VERY comfortable-we had a good nights rest every night. Our view wasn't awesome, but again, we didn't care! It didnt make our trip bad in any way.

Panic ensued on both sides of the desk as the hotel was full due to lots of conventions in town. So, here is one of the big tests of how well a hotel is managed. A guest is staring, or more like glaring at the desk clerk demanding justice; and ya, I was that guy. Why should the desk fellow believe me? He could of just blown me off and said, 'sorry, you messed up'. But, it didn't happen like that. Turns out there was one room left with two queens and a foldout couch that could accommodate all of us. The clerk (wish I could remember his name), immediately booked us, dropped the rate, and gave us all breakfast vouchers. Whoa! 
Nice room, nice beds, typical bath, mini kitchen with micro and sink, small clothes space that allowed for kitchen, but it worked. Really clean. Okay, happiness was all around. The next morning two more interesting things happened. First, the hotel gave each of us gift bags with good chocolate and souvenir Seattle mugs, and showed us to our individual rooms that they cleaned up early. Whoa, again! (Oh, and the breakfast was great at the Emerald Grill). 
Then the students' flight was super late due to weather and it messed up the plan for lunch. The desk clerk saw our stress, overheard our conversation and invited the manager of the Emerald Grill to visit with us about making box lunches. I said we only had thirty minutes to which he replied, 'we can do that'. Thirty minutes later -- box lunches were done and on the bus, including drinks for $-- a piece. Whoa yet again!!

It stayed good. The hotel had our group keys all ready to go, everyone was treated very well, and we had two good morning breakfast buffets that were overseen with great professionalism and care by Sergio.

There are two large mirrors in the room which helped. Our room was cleaned each day while we were out and we appreciated coming back to a nicely made up room. Our only complaint was the cleaning staff threw away some souvineer water bottles we had placed on the dresser. I spoke with one of the staff the next day and suggested they should only throw away items that have been placed in the trashcan. She said they always throw away empty bottles. After that, we hid our bottles in our luggage! I appreciate the cost of a mini-frig being waived because I have medication which must be kept refrigerated. When I mentioned at check-in that I needed the frig, the receptionist arranged it and called me twice to make sure it had been delivered to the room.

id80310,"My cousin and I stayed here over New Year.
The 'el' was so close to the hotel, you can hear it. It's fine once you get used to it, but needs a little adjustment before you do.
Our room was lovely, mainly I think because we had a corner room which made it light and airy, with a view down to the lake. Also, because we had two beds, whihc meant it was reasonably sized. We heard a lady in the elevator complaining about the size of here room and when we went past a room beign serived and could see inside it, it did seem quite small.
The bathroom was good with great products, the bedding was lovely and the location was fabulous. Most things were well within walking distance. There are plenty of places to eat close by, so no need to starve here.
Our complaints were around the lack of... no kettle for tea or coffee making in the room. Why? And wifi was available, but at the most rediculous prices! It was something like £--.-- for basic (good enough to check your emails) a DAY or £--.-- for the faster stuff. As my cousin said - how come most of the coffee shops provide free access while you sip your $- coffee, yet hotels charging huge amounts of money can't offer the same service? I'd advise you to go for a coffee to check your emails! Our other complaint was about the pool area. the pool is TINY, no changing facilities and the jaccussi was out of order for our whole trip, which was rubbish. We were really looking forward to a nice soak after a lot of walking and were hugely disappointed that it wasn't in working order. 
That aside though, we had a nice visit. The hotel lobby is as amazing as everyone says - but all manner of people can wander in and out of the area unchallenged, so make sure you lock everything up okay. 
We recomend the gage, which is on Michigan Avenue for a lovely meal.

Upon our arrival things started on the wrong foot. I had requested a suite with a view and was informed those rooms had been booked and we would be located down the bluff a short ways. When I asked if we would still have a view I was informed that we would. In deed we did, of the main parking lot. In the evening if one leaned way out onto the balcony a thin area of city lights could be seen so I guess the statement wasn't totally untrue.
We found our room, with the aid of a map, and believe me when I say the parking is horrid. If you find a spot in the winding streets comprising the resort, take it, you don't know if you'll ever find another one.
Entering our room to be honest, we almost turned around and left. The rooms (suite) are extremely dated with old mediterranean colors and satiny cloth. After the shock of the old fashioned color scheme wore off we explored the room and found to our delight that it was laid out perfectly for and extended stay. The living area, bathroom and bedroom were very private from each area. Each person could move about the suite without bothering their partner. And of course they have the wonderful Hilton beds.
We did alot of sightseeing but still came back to the resort to take advantage of the great restaurants they offered. Choices were good and prices were reasonable

id80352,"We visit family in Indy at least once a year. We normally stay at the Residence Inn on the Canal, but last time my kids complained about sharing the sleeper sofa and asked if there was a way they could each have their own bed. We chose the Springhill because it was the only hotel we could find with - queen beds + a fold-out couch. Also, it is part of the Marriott family so we got half our stay free with loyalty points. 
The unexpected surprise was the stunning view of White River State Park from our --th floor room. It did remind me of the reflecting pools in DC and was especially gorgeous at dusk and after-dark. Our room and entire hotel had nice furnishings. The beds were comfy, even the fold-out, which was separated from the other beds by an opaque screen. 
The bathroom is split with a toilet and sink-mirror on one side of the closet and and shower and sink-mirror on the other side, both with sliding doors. This was very handy with a teen and tween girl. 
We expected a continental breakfast and were pleasantly surprised that the there also hot items: eggs, sausage, oatmeal, and make-your own waffle. The breakfast line could be better organized as the waffles created a bottle-neck, but that wasn't a big deal since we weren't in a hurry.
You can easily walk to the canal, State Museum, Etiljorg, NCAA Hall of Champions, Victory Field, canal boat and surrey bike rentals, and even a couple of restaurants.
The cafe at the Etiljorg was very pleasant with indoor and outdoor balcony seating overlooking the canal. Zoo and glass gardens with butterflies are maybe a - minute drive. 
The work-out room looks out to the small pool, which is handy for keeping an eye on older kids. 
Parking is $-- self-park and $-- valet and I didn't see any affordable off-site parking options. While it is steep, it is in line with other Indy hotels downtown. It was a little tricky for family members to find as there are many Marriott properties in the area and it shares a building with the Courtyard. A good landmark is that it is just past the giant red check mark sculpture. 
We missed the outdoor balcony and grill at the Residence Inn. My girls said that free cookies (like at Res. Inn) would have """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""enhanced their hotel experience"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". However, Springhill did offer free lollipops and free breakfast. Service was fine--no complaints. I admit Residence Inn was friendlier, probably since we have been going there for years and staff actually remember us from visit-to-visit. 
At the risk of seeming disloyal to Res. Inn, I think we found a new favorite.",InternetExplorer,Desktop
id80353,"I stayed here with co-workers because I recommended it due to TripAdvisor reviews. In retrospect, I was very embarrassed because the hotel was pretty mediocre. There is a Robert Earl Keen song that is called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""It's the Little Things"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the last line is: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""that piss me off."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Well, that's how I felt about this place...it was the little things. To summarize: 
Pros:
*Free Internet
*microwave-refrigerator-coffee maker, popcorn in room
*clean rooms
*safe in closet
Cons:
*Staff never communicated about anything
*Housecleaning would forget things like COFFEE!
*Loud highway noise, even if you are out in the middle of nowhere
To elaborate:
I showed up, requesting a King, non-smoking...I received - doubles and a smoky room, made evident by the fact someone had unwired the smoke alarm. It didn't make me feel very safe that it would be fixed the next day ( I checked in late). 
I ordered room service for breakfast twice, the first day it didn't show in the -- minute window and I called. The lady said she would call me back and right then, there was a knock on the door with the food. A total miscommunication, but no call back to apologize or anything. The next day, it showed up at the top of the -- minute window. On that note, breakfast was tolerable one day, inedible the next. 
The pull out desk is very cramped for doing work on a computer or eating. It basically bumped up into the second double bed. 
The SleepNumber bed is a glorified blowup bed. I didn't sleep at all. 
I had a housekeeping person practically barge into the room--there was one knock: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hello? Wait..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" from me (since I am still dressing, for goodness sake) and then there is someone coming in my room. She apologized a couple of times, but I was over this place and it just seemed like more of the same.
Started noticing the little things...I guess when you are mad, you notice things!--plastic """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tile"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in shower, loud noises in hallway, rip in comforter. It all started to build up for me.
When I checked out, I requested that my second """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""breakfast"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" be taken off the bill. I got the Spanish Inquisition about what I ate and when I ordered it (I had the feeling they didn't believe me), but they took it off the bill. Which I didn't look at when I left. 
Came home to Denver to find out that I had someone else's bill. They faxed mine to me (needed it for reimbursement) and told me that I had two reservations in my name. What?!
All in all, it was just so disappointing. I'm from N. Florida, so I was pretty let-down and embarrassed that I told my co-workers that this was one of the best places to stay for value and service. I'm leaving out so much other stuff because it's ticking me off to think about it!

The hotel catered for meals but on the nights that we hada meal it wasn't that well attended - this was such a shame because, for a hotel, the prices were excellent and far cheaper that any of the other places that we went to. At night I like to have a proper meal rather than fast food type and we did find that it was difficult to find. As well as the normal menu the hotel did an offer of - courses for $--.

I would urge anyone staying here to use the restaurant, I just wish we'd tried it earlier in the stay.

I have stayed in places with shared baths, etc. before so I wasn't expecting anything fancy by any means. I checked in and was taken to my room. I was shown several bathrooms I could chose from. Only was even half way usable. The others had huge brown rust stains and the ceramic-paint was peeling off. It was gross. The hallway was dark, big trash cans in the hallway and the floor was completely uneven. I already felt like I was in a horror movie. I am taken to my room. No light switch - just a bulb with a string in the middle of the room. No phone, no refrigerator, no heat! There was a huge waterstain that covered one wall from floor to ceiling at least half-way across the wall. It was patched with plaster and then repainted over but the plaster was just thrown up there in large chunks and was already beginning to crack again. The sink was sitting on an angle because the floor was so uneven. The carpet was old and dirty - didn't even look vacuumed. The table lamp also didn't work. The guy had to unscrew the lampshade and fiddle with it to get it to work. He looked around and said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""it looks fine, huh?

I wasn't taking any chances!!

The dressing area was right in front of the bed so if you get up before the other person the light shines right on the person trying to sleep. 
Going into the bathroom you could not just walk right in, you had to kind of step in a little to the left in front of the toilet and then open the door the rest of the way so you could actually get into the bathroom.
The pull out sofa bed was horrible for our son. It felt like you were sleeping on a ramp. You're head was up higher than the rest of your body.

 The rooms were spotless and beautifully appointed. The new Kitchens are beautiful with great appliances. Housekeeping even put my toddlers sippy cups into the Miele dishwasher and ran a load for me.

Trust me, those photos of the District hotel have been altered or air-brushed. The tiny lobby was shabby-chic and far exceeded the terrible rooms.
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH MY ROOM AND STAY AT THE DISTRICT HOTEL:
** MY HOTEL ROOM DOOR LOCK DID NOT WORK!!!. Major Security Breech.
** WARNING: This a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""WALK-UP"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" hotel from the street (hope your luggage isn't too heavy or a lot of luggage.... you may be forced to leave some luggage on the curb and pray that no one steals it while you haul your other bags up the - flights of stairs to the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""first floor"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" reception desk..
** NO DESIGNATED CURB SPACE OR PARKING SPACE TO OFF-LOAD LUGGAGE TO CHECK IN TO THE HOTEL.
** Floor ELEVATORS DID NOT WORK. Yes, after hauling your bags from the curb, you may find that was only half the battle. The elevators were permanently out of commission while I was there for - days.
** My flea-bitten full-size bed was the same width as the entire room. When I got out of bed, I was literally standing in the bathroom. Don't know where they got the mattress and bedding, but it had to be -- years old. 
** NO HOT WATER FOR ENTIRE - DAYS!!! The front desk offered to bring me """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""one small bucket of warm water"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to wash my long hair in!!!!! (So, how do I wash, then re-rinse my long hair???) The maintenance man had no idea how to solve the problem.
** Bathroom was awful and freezing. Repair or redo was unfinished - missing tiles, unpainted wall, freezing air blowing in the big cracks around the window, crud, etc. 
** TV NEVER WORKED!! Zilch, nadda, no TV picture at all. A maintenance man had no idea how to solve the problem
** No chair - as there was no space for a chair. 
** Only - small piece of furniture in the room, which was severely damaged and scarred up. Leg on the tiny --drawer bureau was broken off. Bureau propped against the wall so it wouldn't fall over. Drawers didn't work.... but once I saw the crud in the draws, I'd never put my clothes in there!!!
** Closet was a joke. It was about - feet wide and had hooks on the wall instead of hangers. No door on the closet.... probably because the bed blocked half of the closet doorway.
** No place to plug in my computer, place to put it, or place to sit to work.
** NO PARKING!!! Two days in a row, I was told to drive back to the hotel from my business meetings at a specific time to pay for the ONE, LONE PARKING SPACE FOR THE WHOLE HOTEL.. Despite calling to confirm availability, and arriving early both days, the space was not held as promised had been sold to someone else.
** EXPENSIVE, OFF-SITE PARKING IN VERY DANGEROUS PART OF TOWN, ABOUT - BLOCKS AWAY. (The hotel calls this lot """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""close""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""!).

id80412,"I stayed at this hotel for the NCAA basketball regional in Houston with my wife. I have stayed at JW Marriott hotels before and had always had a great experience. The latest in Scottsdale, Arizona where the service and room were outstanding. 
This hotel was a poor value. Here were my issues: 
-. No refrigerator in the room. I called to get one put in and was told I would have one the next day. Told the same thing the next day. When we checked out we were told that the hotel had run out of small refrigerators for the room. 
-. No housekeeping on Saturday. That was not a huge deal to me. But when I called to ask for fresh towels I had to wait over an hour to get fresh towels.
-. Terrible screw up on my bill and no accountability to fix the problem. I pre-paid with a travel agent group at $----night. My incidentals were charged to my credit card. I stayed another night which I was told would be billed to my travel agent and then I would be billed for $--- plus tax. I specifically asked about the rate and was told that it will not be more than $--- plus tax. 
The bill I received to my credit card without my permission was $---. So I guess the hotel thought my extra night's stay on a Sunday night with very few people in the hotel was supposed to be at $----night plus tax. It was a horrible value at $----night. Highway robbery at $----night plus tax. When I called to get this straightened out, i got disconnected several times and bounced around to the billing office where they said I needed to contact the travel agency. 
After wasting an hour of my day dealing with that, I have to call my credit card company to dispute the charge. Extremely poor customer service and problem resolution. 
-. The rooms were tired. Lots of stains on the carpets. To turn on a light switch in our room was to risk electrocution because sparks came out of the switch. Had more of a budget hotel feel than a --star or --star hotel.

The valet guys who also help with the luggage are so friendly and helpful. The concierge managed to get a limo for us to take us to the Emmy's. This was all very short notice and not only did she manage to find someone, she also had a tasty sweet platter delivered to our room that night wishing us a nice day at the Emmy's. Amazing! The guys at the check in were great, too! We needed to store some luggage for a week in the W whilst we were travelling elsewhere in the US and it was no problem at all. Even better, when we came back and checked in again, our stored luggage was quickly delivered to our room. Fab! 
We had a chance to try the --- restaurant, too. The food (and again the service) was great.

Large flat screen TV on wall with adjustable arm to watch from bed, desk or sofa.
I loved the bathroom, it looked great and was really well thought out with a seperate sink and make-up area. Hairdryer plus lots of great toiletries and candles. The bath was fantastic both to look at and to use - so big! The towells were of a great quality, realIy fluffy.
We ate in the restaurant and the food was delicious - have the prawn cocktail starter. The staff were really attentive and professional.
The hotel is on the expensive side but aside from the very pricey Pinot Noir, I think it is priced accordingly for the quality and service, it certainly felt like it during our stay.
I would stay there again and definately reccommend it to friends although I think it is a very particular style and perhaps would seem to dark and mysterious for some people.
The only slight negative is that at night we could hear the lift from our room.

I tried working the air conditioner and the goofy thing was set at --, then I went down to --, and still the fan sat silent. I had it. Packed my bags and went down to the front desk. I explained the situation and they kindly put me in a different room. The front desk agent advised the air conditioner does not kick in until he checks me in. So, in essence I have to spend hours in an extremely hot room until it cools down.
Whether this is a green initiative, or a cheap initiative masked as green, it’s wrong. Unless they take corrective action, I’m packing my bags and going elsewhere. No guest should have to sweat it in their room.
After I calmed down over the air-conditioning fiasco, I noticed that the deadbolt on my next guest room was busted. It was very late and I wasn’t about to call to have it fixed. So in the morning I phoned “Service Express,” for my valet parking pickup and at the same time advised that I’d like maintenance to come back and fix-replace the deadbolt.
I returned later that night after midnight to find that the deadbolt had not been repaired, and no note or other correspondence to indicate why it couldn’t have been fixed.
It’s a shame they dump hundreds of millions into this place, and it falls victim to the same Detroit ethos that ruined the first incarnation of this fabulous building. After a few stays here since it's re-opening as a Westin I'm finding that the physical renovation was fantastic, but the quality of service received from the staff needs serious improvement.

Once we checked in and got to our room, we were very disappointed. The smell was terrible, very musty. We called the front desk to ask about a different room with - beds, but none were available. They offered to come spray the room to get rid of the smell, but couldnt move us. The other con about the room was the heater, the room was freezing and the very noisy unit didn't warm up the room even after - hours of running it. Other than that, the room was good. The bed was very comfortable and there was a nice flat screen tv, a fridge and a microwave, as well as free wifi and a decent complimentary breakfast. I might stay there again if the price is right, but I would bring some sort of air freshener just in case. The AC-heating unit needs to be replaced, and possibly the carpet, but overall it was ok.",Mozilla,Mobile
id80426,"The room was huge and very nice...there was hair in the jacuzzi tub and dead rose petals on the floor, clearly the room was not vaccumed throughly.... The carpet when you walked into the room was soaked, the room was right by the ice machine and that carpet was wet too. I did let them know about it that night, after we came back from our date. Being that I work in the hospitality industry I always carry lysol and clorox wipes with us when we travel so I cleaned the tub and sanitized it before we used it....On a brighter note, the bar in the lobby was nice and the beds were super comfortable. Breakfast was ok...the staff we talked to and seen was very nice and helpful! Great place to stay and in a great location on the north side of Columbus, I would suggest to them to be a little more consious about their cleaning and maybe have head of housekeeping check the rooms a little better.",Safari,Mobile
id80427,"This review is based on a two-night stay in December, ---- and is written by a business traveler who frequents many Marriot-chain and Hilton-chain restaurants throughout the US.
Tagline: meets or exceeds the Courtyard standard; a good bet for your money.
Features - benefits:
 - new sheets - linens; comfortable beds.
 - --MB-s Internet is wired; network card or USB port required.
 - separation between vanity sink and spacisou tub-toilet room.
 - curved shower bars; new shower curtains.
 - bright fluroescent light in the closet.
 - very spacious breakfast area.
 - cook is located outside, preparing waffles and eggs made-to-order for you as part of the buffet.
 - Hotel located two walking blocks from Magnificent Mile.
 - Within walking distance to all types of restaurants.
Cons:
 - Lobby is somewhat small (exascerbated by a major conference being held in town the time my wife and I were there).
 - first room had a toilet that could not acquire water, even though it was fixed; at least front desk staff quickly moved us to another room.
 - Windows and curtains do little to prevent the cold from coming in from the outdoors.
 - Be prepared to hear some amount of road traffic from your room.
 - Price of valet parking can be $-- - $-- per day; however, remember that you are very close to Magnificent Mile.
Summary:
 - Good bet for you money (less than the full Marriotts nearby).
 - I woudl recommend this hotel to friends and family.",InternetExplorer,Tablet

id80430,"My friend & I stayed here last summer, when we arrived the male receptionist was very helpful and carried our suitcases up the stairs. He was very friendly and showed us to our room. The room we had was VERY spacious, with two huge queensize beds, a wardrobe, a fridge, microwave, tv, air con etc. The bathroom was of a good size with a massive shower, all very very clean.
There is also a substantial safe in the wardrobe, I think the key for it was $-- but if you have passports and cash it's definitely worth doing. Not very big but holds cameras, phones and all the necessary things.
The pros definitely outweight the cons, there were only a few problems. The only thing I didn't particularly like was the window into the 'alleyway' (wide and not dodgy at all - just led to some houses) was comprised of some slats on hinges, which didn't seem very secure, but we had no problems whatsoever and like I said the hotel is in a very nice area.
The only major problem we had was despite being told we would only need to pay on departure, reception attempted to charge my card early and upon it being declined (as a safeguard as it's a UK bank account) they called me to say there was a problem.. this left me with bank charges that were not my fault!
We didn't use the pool, but after using the restaurant next door (nice food and friendly staff) we decided not to anyway - you can see the pool through the fence.
I'm not sure of some of the clientèle, I never saw any other guests in --days, bit strange.
The Farmer's Market is a ten minute walk down one road, walked back at --pm one night and felt completely safe. On one side of the road is a park and the Farmer's market and on the other side some very upmarket apartments. On the corner just by the hotel is a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf which is very nice.
We were told by reception LA transport is not very good and spent the whole week travelling in Taxi's as recommended (about $----- to get to Universal Studios) then at the end realised that it's actually very easy! Out the hotel turn left to the crossroads (--minute walk) is a $-.-- bus that goes past Target, fast food chains and takes you straight to Hollywood Blvd! The metro can also be caught here for $-.-- to go as far as you like. Beware though, the metro has a LOT of homeless and 'unsavoury' people riding it and felt a bit dangerous going into downtown LA. If you're going further than Hollywood (especially travelling south) I would definitely recommend hiring a car. Santa Monica pier is about --minutes away via -buses, but again, very easy. (bus route leaflets are on all buses.) Reception are very handy with taxis and airport shuttles, but for public transport I'd work it out for yourself - a lot cheaper.
Hollywood Blvd is full of pick pockets and rude people trying to get you to pay to go on a Hollywood Homes tour, they barter down very quickly so don't just go for their first offer. I think we used Starline Tours which was very worth doing, some of the others are very money grabbing but this company felt a lot more genuine. The Hollywood sign can also be seen from next to the Kodak Theatre!
Definitely go to Universal Studios (a bus and a direct metro - -- minutes) Santa Monica, Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood Homes tour, Farmer's Market and if possible a TV studio filming!
Yes, some parts of the hotel are a little outdated but it's on the edge of Hollywood in a nice area, the price definitely reflects that. I think it would be difficult to find a cleaner hotel in a nicer area than this, would stay again!",Edge,Desktop
id80431,"I got this hotel through Priceline.com and was completely disappointed. I'm not sure how this qualifies as a --star hotel? The lobby area was a complete mess with all the construction going on. It was a zoo trying to check in with all the people coming and going in the tight area. We stayed on the ---floor, which is the same floor as the restaurant and it stunk of food every time we went back to the room. Surprisingly, the rooms were decent and the bed was comfy. I do have to warn you that the walls are extremely thin. We could hear the people next to us talking and flushing the toilet. Also, every time someone walked by our room in the hall way, we could hear their conversations. I tried very hard to sleep in the next morning of my stay but that was nearly impossible with all the people, kids and families walking by and talking. I'm not a light sleeper by any means but the doors must've been made of paper or something. The location is not that ideal if you want to stay in the center of town. This is on the border of NE-NW DC and walking from Judiciary Square metro to the hotel was a little scary. Take my advice - pay a little more and stay at a decent place like the Westin near GW or Georgetown.",Firefox,Desktop

Managed to get VIP tours direct from the hotel to Universal Studios and also did the LA city tour both very good although one driver did overdo it a bit about relying on tips for a living.

You will need transport to get around the area. (it is LA after all) but while this is located in a residential neighbourhood it feels quiet and welcoming. I just didn't feel anything about this hotel. The gym is small and has all the equipment, there is coffee at the front bar in the morning.

I originally had a standard room with a King, but the room was very small. I upgraded to a suite for a reasonable price. The suite was huge. It had a living room, entry area, big bedroom and bathroom. I think it was likely larger than my first apartment. The rooms are very clean, but the sheets need to be replaced. They seemed a little tattered. The bed was pretty comfortable, and the room was a very quiet at night. My biggest complaint is that I could not really control the heat and my room was really hot for sleeping. Also, when I turned on the AC to cool the room, it made a horrible banging noise.

The location is perfect. Madison and --th. Ten minute walk to Rockefeller Center. Twenty minutes to Central Park. One block from Grand Central Station. A couple of blocks from American Girl.
Front desk staff were friendly and accomodating. Inititially there wasn't a room ready for us at Noon, when we arrived. However, the clerk double-checked again after processing our reservation and a room had come available. Great service.
Concierge, doormen and bellhops all very friendly.
Rooms are very small but comfortable and clean. Ladies, if you like to spread your toiletries and make-up out on a counter in the bathroom you will be disappointed. No counter space. But in the scheme of things a minor, minor thing.
Nice thick walls. Very quiet hotel. Barely heard any noise from neighbors or elevator traffic.
I have stayed in very expensive NY hotels too and frankly for the price I paid at The Roosevelt the others are a complete rip off (my price was $--- a night before tax and fees).

Iam from a suburb in amsterdam. Big city same problems. I wadnt scared a bit. There are a LOT homeless people. Ive walked - days from hotel to uniin square. There was -!!! Homeless guy who asked for some change.
If you look like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""oh grab my wallet"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" they smell it.
Besides al the walkings were from mornings till evenings and in the nights. Every time the homeless people hang around the church for food and methadonshots?? If the are annoying they wont get food. If you leave them they leave you.

id80472,"I just returned from a - day stay in Hollywood with my - teenagers ages -- & --. We have enjoyed staying in many - star hotels around the world and have experienced very good service. I have to say that the Magic Castle Hotel can stand with the best when it comes to friendly staff, great service, and cleanliness.
Arrival:
The hotel is centrally located in Hollywood and was easy to find.
The lobby is not large but is very accommodating, welcoming and tastefully decorated. 
The staff greeted us warmly and seemed genuinely friendly. 
On one side of the lobby there was a large arrangement of cookies, an assortment of teas, spiced cider, and packets for hot chocolate. There was also cool water containing sliced cucumbers.
A delicious continental breakfast is served every morning from -- --AM. The food is arranged in the lobby and can be enjoyed out by the pool or you can take it to your room.
Checking in was quick and the staff carried our luggage to our room which was on the second level. There are no elevators but 
there are rooms on the ground level if stairs are a challenge. There are also a few steps to the front entrance of the hotel.
The rooms surround a large, lovely courtyard. Many of the rooms on the second and third levels have balconys overlooking the courtyard. Ours did not but I will know to ask ahead for one next time we visit.
In the center of the courtyard is a 'splash pool'. If you want Olympic laps this is not the pool for you. It is just the right size for a refreshing dip and floating around. My kids loved it.
Our room:
We had the junior suite and found it to be fairly large and very clean. 
The carpeting looked new.
In addition to the TV there was a DVD player and CD player. My kids brought their laptops and there was wirless internet for them.
The hotel has a nice complimentay DVD library. When my kids went to select DVDs they were surprised with a complimentary bucket of microwave popcorn packets and an assortment of candy. 
The beds have down comforters and the mattresses were firm and comfortable. Turndown service is provided every evening along with chocolate mints.
Location:
The hotel is located at the foot of a hill within - blocks of busy Hollywood Blvd. Once you turn off of Hollywood Blvd the crowds and noise seem to thin out appreciably.
The subway is about - blocks from the hotel on Hollywood Blvd and we used it to get to Universal Studios. 
The city was in preparation for the Oscars while we were there. All of these preparations take place in the - block area close to the hotel. The Hollywood- Highland subway stop is closed on the day of the Oscars. Metro and auto traffic is detoured as well beginning several days before the Oscar presentations. Pedestrian traffic is also detoured on Hollywood Blvd beginning several days prior to Oscar day but all the major sights are still accessible such as the Kodak theater, walk of fame, and Chinese theater. I was told that this inconvenience only happens during the week of Oscar preparations every year. 
We found it fun and exciting to watch the city get ready for the Oscars day by day despite the inconvenience of the detours.
Staff:
I have never been treated better at any hotel that I have ever stayed at. The staff just go out of their way to make your stay pleasant and enjoyable. They are friendly, courteous and they let you know that they are there for you. When my kids were up into the night with jet lag I spent lots of time going to the lobby for DVD's and snacks and Marzia on the night shift was so patient and helpful. All the staff should be commended.
They give you - star service and - star treatment. There are lots of bigger, grander, more luxurious hotels in L.A. but the staff at the Magic Castle make it stand along side any of them. In my opinion, there is none better.

A phone and speaker from the TV are pretty cool! The bathtub had to be one of the largest I've seen, it even had a seat in the tub! The blue tile mosaic is really cool looking. Plenty of bath products are provided. The coolest part was the mirror when you took a shower and it fogged up, there was a huge heated spot clear of fog! The beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept on, with plenty of pillows and covers. The huge --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" TV was a nice touch! The room had a coffee maker, rare find in nice hotels! The desk slid out, one of Marriott's cool features! The desk chair and other chair were very comfortable.

It does promise stylish design on the website, but that is about all it delievered. We were given a smoking room when we had booked a non smoking room. There was stale cigarette stench on the -th floor and in the bedroom so it was difficult to breathe. The room was big enough to fit a bed and to allow guests to get into the bed, but that is about it.
When we asked for our room to be changed to non-smoking we were told that we had arrived too late, and that rooms were allocated on a first come first served basis. So it was a competition to see who could arrive by - p.m. and it was our fault! The person at reception was very rude, said there was nothing they could do making no attempt at reparations.
Calling down to reception was impossible because there was too much noise coming from the DJ. 
The hotel was very dirty in the common parts, the lifts need a good vacuum clean, although the room was acceptable. 
Except in the check in area and restaurant, the rest of the hotel was unbelievably dark and dingy. I felt I was in a tennament in communist Russia (albeit with a carpet). The room design itself was a nice idea, but again, badly executed.
This hotel is a nice idea, very badly executed. I could deal with the small rooms, the stale cigarette air and even the dirty communal areas, but such a low level of service is unpardonable.

The bed was good. Now the negatives. Although we requested a quiet room, we had outdoor weddings right below our room on both Saturday and Sunday nights with DJs and lots of noise. Apparentally this is somewhat common in October and November. The hotel was full and there were not enough tables at breakfast and they were out of coffee, etc. We didn't go to the free cocktails, again due to long lines and lack of seating. I don't think we will stay here again and will look elsewhere in a market full of alternatives.",IE,Desktop

I wasn't sure what to expect as I got it pretty cheap considering where it is.It is right in the middle of time square but quiet. Its a perfect size and really beautiful inside. I love how its been decorated all funking but not in your face. The staff were truly lovely and really helpful, quick to help with anything. Room was a great size for two and shower was the best thing ever after a very long day shopping.
The beds were made in heaven I'm sure and I'm usually really fussy.
The room was cleaned every day to a really good standard, with fresh towels and bedding.
I could go on for ever about Room Mate Grace it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in and it made my dream holiday perfect.
Thanks to all the staff :)
I should mention though to all due to stay. On arriving they took my bank details for security. I didn't question this and didn't think anything of it. Then $--- went out of my bank leaving me $--- down on spending money and panicing me as I was unable to contact my bank in USA.
On my return back to Uk I called bank ASAP to find out the hotel had actually taken the money without my knowledge. Then I had to call the hotel running up a bill on my mobile as it was international. The guy i spoke to explained they always do this on check in then refund it after you check out. I'm still waiting a couple of days on for the money and hoping not t to have to call again. I'm really not happy this was never explained to me and i was left short on holiday plus full of worry for a week and now wondering if I'll get it back.
So be aware, take enough to cover and check it out on arrival.

On our second visit over Thanksgiving, $--- per night got us a bigger room this time but a smaller bathroom. This room had carpet dirt spots in the entry way. The staff wasn't as friendly has the first visit but they were still helpful in time of need. The room service was timely and the food was ok.

id80503,"The quick and dirty: there are several other --star hotels in downtown Austin I would rate above Hyatt. My biggest beef is with cleanliness. There were hairs in the shower upon check in (several not off one's head, too), and a little pile of hairs on the floor in the corner behind the door that never was swept up during my stay. It looked as if someone had shaved and brushed the hairs into a corner that the maid never saw.
The other (somewhat more bothersome) problem was the total lack of hot-warm water at night. I shower at night, thus I had to bathe in uncomfortably cool water. My wife had plenty of warm water in the mornings, however.
I am not hating on the Hyatt brand by any means. In fact, I had a very pleasant stay at the Hyatt Place in North Central Austin about - weeks ago. I would actually recommend that particular Hyatt Place over the Hyatt Regency on the Lake, if one is not so much concerned with location (so many things are within walking distance from the Hyatt Regency Downtown; not so from the North Central Austin Hyatt Place). 
In any event, this particular Hyatt Regency is pretty good, but felt more like a --star. The hot water issue was most troublesome. The cleanliness issue was something I would expect at a Red Roof Inn, not a Hyatt. All in all, the hotel is decent, but not stellar.

Karina, on reception was excellent. She said we could relax now and let them look after us and as she spoke I could physically feel myself relaxing! They looked after us very well. Nothing was too much trouble - the room was gorgeous - really clean, comfy with everything we could want. We asked for a high floor, and whereas some hotels can be unhelpful with requests, Karina ensured we had exactly what we requested. The room was bright, as well as spacious. We extended our stay for an extra night just because the hotel-people were so nice. The location is brill too; only a few blocks away from The River Walk, Hemisfair Park and all amenities. We were able to go out in the morning and return for a rest when we were exhausted, before going out again! It is certainly worth going up the Americas Tower in Hemis Fair Park to see the views over San Antonio.

Between the water and the humidity my hair was really frizzy. I thought the decor was very nice and cultured. The building is historic so if you are looking for 'brand new' book yourself at the Westin or some place like that. We walked all over the city during the day and took cabs at night. I would suggest taking a straight walking path down Sutter to downtown if that is where you are going. In this city if you go one street over depending on where you are there are many homeless people. We were not bothered by them but I did hear from people that they can be very agressive.

The location is fine - along I--- about -- miles north of downtown Phoenix. The hotel lobby is very nice - a design that matches well with the desert outside. For a hotel like the Crowne Plaza, the room was just average I thought. However, the beds were very comfortable. 
The one major problem we had while staying here was with the AC-heater - we couldn't get the heater to shut off all night even though we had the temperature set correctly. So the room was way too hot. I couldn't imagine what it would be like if you had a similar problem staying here during Phoenix's summer. 
There's not really much near this hotel - we had to drive quite a ways to find a decent restaurant or even a gas station. That seems to be what Phoenix is like in general.
I am a member of the Priority Club, and they gave me passes for two free happy hour drinks, and a pass for a free breakfast buffet. Never did take a chance on either of these though.

We booked a king but got a full-almost queen bed that we couldn't walk around without hitting a wall. We couldn't even open our luggage b-c the room was so small.

While the hotel seems grand and the grounds expansive, the attention to details that make a big resort seem to care for the individual are mostly missing- especially after sundown. There are areas you can see from the hotel- but they're not lit, or there's no access, or the firepits aren't lit at night. It's a big place, and I get the feeling that crowd management is a priority. For instance, poolside dining-cocktails end at around -. The pools AND jacuzzi shut down at -pm. and most of the beautiful grounds are literally locked off after that time. The end result is that folks are herded into the dining rooms, main veranda and lobby.

id80535,"Before staying at this hotel, I had a very positive opinion of Kimpton from previous stays. However this hotel substantially reduced my opinion. 
The Topaz has a great location near Dupont Circle, but the hotel itself has terrible views. Outside my window is an alley, a dumpster (which was dumped last night at - am and woke me up) and another building... and I'm on one of the highest floors. Next to the hotel are buildings with boarded up windows.
The rooms are very large, but old. The material of the building is cheap, for example there are popcorn ceilings and the paint in my room is chipped.
The amenities are terrible - no gym, and the room service menu is unacceptable, especially for a vegetarian. During a week, I'll normally eat --- room service meals, but this week I've had none because nothing on the menu is even remotely appetizing. 
Also, the staff does not pay attention to detail. When checking in, I registered as Dr. Soandso, not that I care, but their registration form asked. During the entire stay (approximately -- interactions with the front desk), I've been addressed as Mr. Soandso. Again, it doesn't bother me and I never say anything, but high end hotels (which Kimpton claims to be) usually pay attention to these details (for example, who is on vacation, who is on a honeymoon, etc). The hotel staff apparently do not care at this location.

On our first night, my husband and I asked him for a restaurant recommendation. He recommended - of his favorites by providing menus, reviews and directions (we chose Cafe Maritime). On the second night of our stay, we decided to stay in. We had walked all the way to Fisherman's Wharf, the Ferry Building and back and we were too exhausted and achy to do much more than enjoy a glass or two of wine and climb into our very comfy bed. Julio made up a bowl of fruit for us to enjoy as an evening snack. Honestly, no hotel employee has ever made that effort with us before.

Some of the other amenities we enjoyed: free bottled water in the room, the delicious cookies offered at nightly turn-down service, a customized tourist package, coffee and tea service offered off the reception area and the additional amenities offered for purchase in the room.

I chose The W because of the branding and it looked like a great hotel with the pictures and reviews. From the moment I pulled up to the valet, the customer service was First Class. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The HR coordinator and hotel manager should be proud of the staff. I was impressed with the lobby, very Chic. The front desk was able to get me into my room about - hours early and gave me a great room (for my price range). That is where they fall short. When it was originally done, I could tell the room was very fresh. However, after a couple of years, it has taken its toll. The carpet had stains, the baseboards were coming away from the wall, the walls were scuffed and needed repainting, the blinds had torn cords and the built-in furniture and bed were basically white painted plywood that needed a fresh coat of paint. 
The location is a little off the beaten path, but if you don’t have a car, they have a free service (nice touch). Also, if you are just up in your room for an hour, the valet will just leave your car out front so it’s extremely convenient to get to when you go in and out. 
So, the only reason the W does not get a - star rating is for the price that I paid, I just expected the room to be almost perfect. I came to hotel to basically stay in the room and enjoy my time at the hotel, but found that I did go out more than I planned since I was a little disappointed. The nice thing is that my only critique is something that can be easily fixed with just some of the money that is brought in by the nightly charges.

That goes for Tameeka and Andrew who work behind the counter. Dawne Smith the manager and Alex the owner.

Our hotel requirements were - beds, in order that we could all sleep well, and a kitchen to help us save money on food, and great location. The beds were firm with very nice sheets on them and my son was thrilled to have the whole living room to himself along with a very large flat-screened TV. The furniture looked new in the living room as well as the carpet. As noted in previous reviews, one elevator was out for most of our stay. You can take the freight elevator if you'd like a real flavor of old New York, which we used exclusively since it was by our room. When checking in I asked for a rear room and was given an end room-long and skinny with the living room at the street and the bedroom at the rear. The bedroom was quiet, but the front was noisier with the street noise.
 We did not try the hotel breakfast since we went to the store (Morton Williams Marketplace) a block and a half west to get supplies. They have fresh produce, groceries, a deli, pizzeria, and a hot and cold buffet. 
 We saved lots of time and money by eating breakfast in the room each day. We usually stopped somewhere nice for lunch and then had soup or leftovers for dinner. Our total food-restaurant bill for the - of us was $--- for - days. We had Angelo's pizza delivered which was very good, Tony's di Napoli by Time's Square served family style and was a very fair price for great food, Lansky's Deli was a great lunch place with local flavor (try the mazza ball soup).

- Comfortable bedding; slept well
- Impressive fitness center for a mid-tier hotel: high-end fitness equipment with individual TVs on each piece of equipment. Water, cups, and towels provided at the fitness center.
- Friendly and efficient front desk staff . . . same for restaurant staff . . . I had forgotten my toothbrush and was cheerfully given a complimentary one.
- Fresh cookies at the front desk during the evening
- Spacious lobby good for meeting colleagues (e.g., to go over the presentation one last time), though some electrical outlets in the lobby would be nice.
- Much more affordable than comparable lodging in downtown Boston . . . and really not too hard to get to-from downtown using the hotel's shuttle in concert with the “T” (subway).
 Cons:
- There is really nothing at all within walking distance of the property . . . the neighborhood is rental car lots, warehouses, and industrial facilities strung along an unwalkable busy highway. No restaurants, not even fast food, no convenience stores, no nothing. So if you don’t have a rental car, you are kind of hostage to the hotel restaurant for your meals unless you want to go through the hassle of taking the (free) hotel shuttle to the T station and then riding the T to a more happenin’ neighborhood.
- Limited TV channel selection – no MSNBC, no Comedy Central.
- Breakfast buffet was lame and overpriced as is usually the case at mid-tier hotels. I’d love to have hotel restaurant profit margins.
- Desk- work area was kind of small’ not much space from front to back of desk (which was really just a counter up against the wall).
- Common areas like hallways and elevator lobbies are looking worn.
- There’s a wee bit of airport noise, but insufficient to bother all but the most sensitive sleepers

id80563,"This hotel has the potential to be a really good place to stay but it needs to overcome its ho hum approach.
I like that it's well-located in MIdtown and a four block walk to either Grand Central or --rd Street subway. The rooms are a good size, well appointed and there's a great place - Lucid - next door that does an excellent latte. There's also some good restaurants within walking distance.
But, that's really about all I can say I liked.
I didn't like that I booked a specific room seven months ahead and arrived to find that it wasn't available. Normally, I'm happy to have a room in a decent hotel but I booked the room specifically because it had a bedroom and separate sitting area and because it was for a two week stay. I had two friends flying in from Australia to meet me after six months and we had another friend who was in NYC at the same time - we wanted the separate area to meet and hang out. So, despite the fact that the hotel had sent me a few email reminders to personalise my stay and to confirm my stay, I have to say it was REALLY surprising that they couldn't email me ahead of time and let me know that the room wasn't available. When I mentioned my surprise at the room not being available and that I hadn't been notified, the hotel said they would provide an equal accommodation option, which ended up being two adjoining rooms. This was ok but not what we wanted. Quite frankly, if I had known this ahead of time I would have looked elsewhere.
There are lots of other little things that the hotel just missed - so here's a few examples. 
So, we check in and get no introduction to the hotel's services - free wi-fi in the lobby (as opposed to the expensive option available in the room), where the different services were located etc. If I compare the lack of attention to detail to previous hotel stays, this really isn't what I'd call a welcome.
There was the barman who didn't know how to make a cocktail on their list (they don't have that many) and bar staff who seemed a bit interrupted when we tried to order drinks. 
We too had housekeeping banging on doors to get in to service our rooms. When we asked why, we were told we had to hang out our door sign to let them know we were in or out of the room - ok. But this is the first hotel I've ever stayed at where the housekeeping team have been so consistently pushy to get in to service the room. Accessing the bar on the rooftop has been referred to in other people's reviews - it too has the potential to be great but as it's not operated by the hotel, they take a hands off approach.
On a more positive note, I would like to say that Dennis, the doorman, is fantastic and he made up for the rather lacklustre service and attitude (read bored-disinterested etc) elsewhere in the hotel.
I think there are better options out there until the hotel can get its act together. Maybe everyone was just tired because they were busy. Anyway, I've given the hotel the same feedback. Happy travels.",Firefox,Mobile

Amazing choices in dining all around. I also utilized the in hotel store and found it to be very reasonable. My room was quiet and the bed was very comfortable.
 The free cooked to order eggs in the morning and free cocktail reception in the evening was icing on the cake. The internet is only $- and was fast and reliable. If you can walk the few blocks to Pazanos. Amazing.",Edge,Mobile
id80565,"I stayed here with a friend who was in town for a conference at the university. The hotel is nicely appointed. The room was on the smallish side, but clean, crisp and new feeling-looking. The cafe seemed to have kind of strange hours, couldn't seem to catch a meal there, so can't speak to it. Also didn't have a car, but I bet there's free parking. That would be a major bonus. The internet was high speed and free. The grounds of the university are beautiful. It's a nice short walk to H Street with some great places to eat. We really like Ethiopian so that was a plus to be able to walk there. Capital Hill neighborhood is also a nice walk.
The negatives: the shuttle (maybe b-c it's summertime) was nearly always late and unreliable. The walk to the metro is through a depressed area and maybe dicey at night. The service is not like a regular hotel. There is one person who staffs the desk and it's a kid! They looked like maybe early --'s. The guy had no clue about anything, including what building the pool was in and wasn't about to try to find out.

As a Hilton Reward member, we received coupons for free continental breakfast for both mornings & coupons for other freebies and-or discounts at the hotel. The lobby is very spacious and welcoming with two complimentary computers with Internet access. In the morning they had a coffee bar and in the afternoon and evening there was a bar for adult drinks.
Our room was amazing with a great view! The room looked newly decorated and was immaculate. We had two comfortable queen-sized beds with lots of types of pillows. The bathroom was quite large with a full range of amenities. Free Internet access was included with our stay, but I'm not sure if this was one of the perks for being a Hilton Reward member. The room had a built-in desk which was quite large to put all our stuff on. 
We found the Financial District a very good location for our vacation. We were within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf, China Town, Cable Car Museum and the cable cars. We walked most of our trip and this was with two children, - & -- years old.
My only complaint about the area was that it was somewhat loud at night, but I'm guessing it's loud almost everywhere in the city. I'd recommend asking for a high floor to get away from the street noise.
We parked in the underground parking area and I think it was $--.-- a day.
One thing that stands out in my mind was the exceptional service we had. The receptionist went out of her way to help us get something printed for our trip. We also found the people who worked at the breakfast buffet to be very helpful and courteous.

id80574,"I have stayed here several times for business and pleasure. Its very convenient, especially when attending a conference at the Hilton across the street, which is a popular midtown conference hotel and has very dated rooms. The rooms and service are of good value because of the size of the room and smallness of the hotel. I prefer the more intimate setting to the large busy midtown hotels.
My recent weeklong stay went well but I did notice some of the service and quality slipping. The room was nice, as usual, but the furniture is showing signs of wear. I noticed stains in sofa and carpet. They appeared to be old as well.
Also during the stay the service in the restaurant and bar was sub par. There was a couple large conferences at hilton so the bar was busy but they should have been prepared and many of the issues seemed to be from poorly trained staff. Getting a drink was a chore and placing an order, even when the bar wasn't busy, required flagging people down. Food orders took an inordinate amount of time as well. For instance, our first day we sat down for breakfast and left for the diner down the street after sitting at an undersized table for our group for -- minutes with no one greeting us. If you are paying up for breakfast that can be had many places on -th ave for half the price the service should be great.
Note for AMEX Card Holders: Many people book this hotel through the Amex Luxury Hotels program which provides free breakfast.

The really distorting thing the Hyatt is doing since day - I visited is the $- by bag charge for luggage storage, to me probably the most annoying factor when visiting a hotel of this category.

There's even a decent overview of the history of the building along the wall outside of the conference area and a maritime museum (free of charge) adjacent to the lobby. It's a nautical theme throughout the hotel as it should be given the location and name of the hotel.
We took full advantage of the Wine Hour, as did pretty much everyone else since the lobby was packed. Lots of sitting area and friendly guests to chat with. They were pouring Penfold's and also served hot toddies. The restaurant connected to the hotel, The Blue Mermaid, had their chef providing appetizer samples. We would have had dinner there had we not already made reservations elsewhere.
The room was nice appointed. Comfortable bed, bright clean bathroom, desk-chair wireless internet, TV, fridge stocked with the usual Kimpton Hotel chain goodies, iPod docking station. Again, the theme was nautical in the rooms with a dark blue and yellow color scheme. We had an interior courtyard view which really meant we had a view of other rooms. Looking down, we'd see the white painted roof of the lobby. Not that big of a deal, plus I think my other half got a kick out of being able to see other rooms and vice versa. I just want to see the Bay or Alcatraz. But aside from the lack of a great view, the room was perfect.
Parking is, well, how you'd expect parking to be in SF. Valet parking is pretty much mandatory as everything else is metered parking or a garage that is a decent distance away. Valet is expensive, $--+, maybe more. We already knew this when making the reservation so we opted to spring for the valet included package which ends up costing us only $--. Also, if you drive a hybrid, there is a valet discount. A word of warning, I'm not sure where they store your car, but it takes some time to get your car. We had left some items we wanted for the evening in the car and it took the attendant about ----- minutes to bring our car around. There are in-and-out valet privileges, so that's a plus.
The location of the hotel is on the west end of Fisherman's Wharf, a couple of golf shots away from Ghirardelli Square and close to a lot of eateries, ranging from In-N-Out Burger, Boudin Bakery & Restaurant, Clam Chowder Row, and Cioppino's.

The room was worn, though. The carpet was either very dirty or (I hope) discolored and there were places where the carpet had obviously been patched. The wallpaper was peeling in spots. The loveseat was in pretty good condition, but both the desk chair and the lounge chair were fraying and quite worn. One of the blinds did not work properly.

I asked what size of room we were in ( The Clift upgraded us to a Suite without having to ask) Our unhepful check in clerk said that it was a queen size bed, but some people felt the rooms were small ( and he honestly sniggered to himself) Once in the room it was apparent that things would be cramped - our - suitcases just fit in the clothing area which was one shelve ( no drawers)and - hangers each. The large mirrors on two walls did not gin teh illusion of space as planned. The AC unit is built into the headboard making the bed seem as if you are sleeping on a hairdryer !!

I visited reception on Friday morning to discover that no hold existed, and that they would not hold the room long enough for me to return to the room to discuss the additional $--- upgrade charge per night.

The rooms are small as others have posted but that is NYC. They were clean and the beds were very comfortable. It was so quiet too, we never heard anyone in the halls and no traffic outside. Elevators do take a while during peak times - we found the weekday mornings a little less crowded than weekends. The breakfast had an excellent variety and the warm cookies at night and coffee, hot chocolate, and fruit available all day was wonderful. Young woman at concierge was very helpful. A couple minor issues in the room and maintenance was there immediately. Free wi-fi and business center. Only a few blocks from times square and one block to nearest subway station. Overall, we could not believe the courteous staff, quietness, and little extras this hotel offerred! Without a doubt, we would stay again! A huge thanks to the staff at this hotel!",Firefox,Desktop

id80649,"I have stayed at this hotel before the renovations. First impression is that the hotel, both lobby area and rooms have a refresh look especially for the rooms. Before the renovations, the rooms were really outdated and very tired looking, now, the room is much better and refreshing.
However I did encounter a very bad experience upon arrival. Wanted to park within the front of the hotel to just check-in and leave the luggage in the room. Normally it is concierge parking for that part which I informed the concierge and was told that even for that I needed to pay the normal charges even for the ----- mins. Was told to leave or pay, so I decided to try and get a parking along the street which I luckily found one. Found out later on when checking in that guests are indeed allowed to leave their car for ----- mins for the check-in-out process. Only got an apology from the front desk and that was all.
As an Elite member, you get nothing in the weekends, the lounge is close and there is no breakfast given too. Ok, this is within the program rule, but most of the hotels I have been too, hotels normally go one step further and still provide complimentary breakfast to Elite members when the lounge is closed, but sadly this hotel decided not to go that one step.
Overall the room was as expected, size of room ok with quite a small bathroom. Location is good, close to China Town and Union Square at the cross-junction of both cable-car lines.
Value for money - Ok but not great.
Staff: Ok, still find them a bit cold (same experience from previous stay). 
Would I return, maybe but might try other Marriott's or even maybe the Hilton down the street, at least I am guaranteed breakfast as a Elite even in weekends!",IE,Mobile
id80650,"Let me start with the positive things. This hotel has an excellent location; there are two underground stations nearby and Broadway is a five minute walk. If you want to go to the theatre in Broadway, this is the place to stay. You can even pop in to one of the numerous restaurants on the way back from the theatre. The room is clean and it is mainly in the room that you feel the price value ratio is OK. I also liked the complimentary morning papers in front of the door and staff was extremely helpful, too. And now the negative side. In this hotel you definitely feel that tourism is an industry and within that mass industry. The place was busy all the time people, with groups of people coming and going all the time. No doubt, this is what a hotel is for but not if the group comes home at night and you have to call security before you can go to sleep. It was a large group of young people and they decided to sit down in the corridor in front of the bedrooms and eat their pizzas there. Security sorted out the problem after my second call. Breakfast reminded me of a school canteen breakfast with disposable catering supplies and although there was a different cooked meal every morning, the food became rather boring after the third day. In sum, the location is excellent as was the room but the rest could have been much better for the price we paid for our stay.",InternetExplorer,Tablet

The primary draw of this place is that you can leave your car here for - days and walk right into the airport terminal. Consequently, they are always full and don't really need to be great. Unless you need to leave a car, I'd advise staying a few miles away from the airport where they need your business and will try harder.",Firefox,Tablet

We had a nice room equipped with a microwave and refrigerator. The room was clean and not smelly.
Service was good also.
The only disappointment that we had was the internet service was not wireless and the continental breakfast was just ok. I stay in mostly Hampton Inns and I guess I'm spoiled by the value that I get when I stay there.

Our room was not serviced on one of the days and we also had a problem with the toilet however when I called reception it was dealt with straight away. Staff were very pleasant and helpful special recommendation goes to Leo on Concierge who was extremley helpful and polite. Hotel bar and restaurant was also very nice, although didn't eat there the food looked superb however the hotel needs to market the restaurant a little more. We ate in an Italian ( I think) across the street and it was excellent. Would stay here again.",Safari,Desktop
id80656,"Wow Wow Wow,
As a manager in a hotel it is rare that a hotel meets there own worst critics approval but you did and then some.
Upon check in there were several guest in front of me however the guest services representative promptly acknowledge my arrival and said he would be with me in just a moment. Armando was handling it all with style. Had two guests that were complaining about the noise coming from the adjacent restaurant adjacent parking lot. Additionally he took a phone call from a prospective employee inquiring about the status of their application. Two guests needing driving directions and two guests checking in
The whole time he was courteous and polite. When my turn came he swiped my card and then explained evening happy hour and the morning breakfast including where it was located.
Upon going to my room I had been assigned a king accessible room with a bathtub. As I had made my reservations online and had added a note that I would like to have a King room with a roll in shower I got back to inquire if such a room might be available. Again Armando was covered up in guest but is being assisted by whom I would say was the General Manager. He said he did not have a king room but thought he had a double and would that work. I said yes it would. He gave me a key to the room he was referring to for me to look in and see if that would work. 
Upon returning to the Front Desk he very quickly made the room change.
The room was one of the cleanest rooms I have seen in along time. Again I inspect - rooms a day in my own hotel so that is saying a lot. 
As I was coming in with my second load of luggage the housekeeper assisted me with the door and offered assistance.
I returned to the hotel about - pm and thought I would go check out those chicken strips that Armando had referred to. What a surprise at the buffet that was available. I was clean well stocked which was not an easy feet with what appeared to be a highschool group block in house. During my time in the hospitality area the same lady that I had seen at the front desk was out doing what some of us old hospitality people call touching the tables. I was so refreshing to see that level of hospitality been presented from the top. I was quite evident that she has trained all of her staff well and that are a team that are pulled together by leadership and example.
Over my two night stay it was witnessed over and over. From the housekeeper that asked how the dogs were to the maintenance man that was greeting a guest in the lobby to the persons working the hospitality area.

I wouldn't stay here as a tourist, just since it's really a little beyond walking distance to the inner harbor hot spots. It has a tiny paking lot for $---night, isn't really in a great neighborhood, and has no restaurant besides the breakfast nook. Otherwise, it's a steal compared to other hotels closer to the inner harbor. My room was very clean, the free internet was fast, and there's plenty of take-out-eat-in restaurants in the area. The lobby is suprisingly spacious for a small hotel, no doubt because it was a former bank. There are offices even built into the old vault behind the reception desk. Check-in and out was super-fast. The flat-screen TV, refrigerator, coffee maker, and microwave were all in perfect working order. For business, I would stay here again.",Edge,Desktop

They had a nice business center that was free to use...and free WiFi. The staff was very friendly as well. I just wish we had time to use some of the things I just described.

I contacted the front desk and spoke to a front desk manager named Chris who insisted that I was booked in an executive suite and would not resolve the issue. Chris claimed to not be aware of the general size of an executive suite, and would not send someone to investigate the size of the room, nor did he appear willing to do anything to resolve this issue. Chris acknowledged that deluxe rooms are up to --- square feet, and that executive suites are an upgrade but the upgrade is based on appointments, not size.

If you compare that to the price difference between staying downtown on a weekend or central park, its cheap! 
We stayed in a Club floor, water facing room for $----night. The Club floor has the usual lounge with free food and drinks a few times a day. What was different was the quality of the food and drink. It didn't feel like 'free' stuff- everything they served for free would have fit in perfectly had it been served in the downstairs restaurant. Two special notes, the cheese board they served had cheese from Artisanal (a fantastic NYC cheese shop-bistro) and they served champagne, not sparkling wine- both suprise treats for club lounge freebees.
The room itself was large and had a fantastic view of Battery Park and the Statue of Liberty. The telescope looked good in the room, but was a piece of junk- a nice pair of binoculars would have been a better idea. The bed was great and they got our bedding request just right (you can order different kinds of pillows and mattress tops). The bathroom was spacious and well stocked. It was just what you'd expect from an upmarket chain hotel- not personal, but in excellent taste. 
The staff was perfect. They did the standard remember your name thing and what you drink, but they did it without it seeming strained. When they called us by name it was always correct and if they were unsure, they just used 'sir' or 'ma'am'. They were just professionals doing an excellent job.
My only concern is with the car serive. We arranged through the hotel to be picked up and dropped of at JFK.

Service was okay, unfortunately when housekeeping came to clean the rooms there were no clean washcloths provided for either rooms (and yes I did leave a tip! Lol). Also did not replinish the facial wash. 
Loved the free apples and flavored water in the lobby, and the complimentary umbrellas as it was raining. The lounge and nightspot looked great and both were busy, but alas I had my younger nieces wth me so I passed on that.

We booked this in July having researched Trip Advisor at which time rated the hotel number one in Washington.
The location of the hotel is excellent and just a short walk from Dupont Circle metro station.
The Dupont Circle area has numerous eateries to suit all tastes and budgets.
Our room was a standard room on the -th floor and met all our requirements with large bathroom-comfortable bed-televison etc. It was clean-modern and certainly comfortable.
A good nights sleep was no problem.
Part of our package was a buffet breakfast which was certainly sufficent in itself but the value of same could be used to mix and match from the main breakfast menu.
The hotel provided free limitless coffee in the foyer each morning and had a free wine hour in the evneing but we were always too late in returning and missed it.
Bad news for two people from Scotland.
All staff could not be more helpful including porters-door staff and waiting staff and advice given on places to visit and how to get there.
My only concern and it is a small one is that the hotel is primarily based at business clientel and can be extremely busy and as tourist it is easy to be engulfed by busy business people.

Three times we requested at taxi and three times hotel staff organized limo drivers who they seemed to know very well. These drivers did not have vehicles with meters and therefore just named their price. The drivers were not cheap by any means however they were punctual. On the whole though, we were dissatisfied with this element of our stay because we felt like we paid more for drivers than we would have paid for a taxi.

There are many comments about both the hotel and The Towers regarding the age of the hotel. Guess what? It is an old hotel, but doesn't everyone know that when they check-in? It is what it is -- a grand hotel with a rich history. 
It was my experience to communicate with the hotel staff prior to our arrival to ensure the occasion for our visit was one to be remembered and the staff went above and beyond the call of duty to make our stay memorable. From the doormen to the bell captain to the front desk attendants to the maids -- they all provide exemplary service.

id80699,"I stayed at the Blake this past weekend I have been reading these reviews since last August ----. I have been planning to come to Charlotte for CIAA weekend since then. I had a choice between the Westin and the Blake Hotel price wise the Westin was a little higher and due to the events going on this weekend I expected prices to be a little higher. Even tho I read bad review after bad review after bad review I said to myself this cant be that bad how are they staying in business I read the response from the management that they are under renovation and should be done soon I will give them the benefit of the doubt. So I chose the Blake...I already had low expectations but were hoping for the best.. I like the Hotels location it was with in walking distance of the Epic center where most of the CIAA events where but it was close enough to the high way where if you wanted to leave the downtown area you could and avoid the heavy traffic else where... As in other reviews I read.. The lobby area is real nice the front desk staff where nice polite had no problems checking in room was booked on the -th floor so we take the elevator which I could expect due to the heavy volume of people and usage would be slow no problem.. Get to the room open the door the room was decent clean what I expected from the reviews nice sized room, - star price but motel - quality , I am not that picky but the room decor can be stepped up a lot, The bath room seemed to be something straight out of the --s it was cleaned to the best of what was to be expected everything was out dated nothing about the room said $--- dollars a night but due to the weekend and the events going on I said oh well.. As in other reviews the room was kinda stuffy I tried turning on the air to cool the room off it was not working , I set the thermostat on -- degrees the room never fully cooled off .. Cool I had low expectation any way I could deal with it ..On to the next disappointment .. I go to take a shower and I have never ever in my life had a shower where you could not adjust the water to a comfortable level.. I was expecting the water not to be as warm due to demand and usage during this weekend.. THis was not the case you set the shower and the water would go from warm to steaming scalding hot even if you had the cold water turned all the way up you could not cool the water down. One of my room mates actually has a small burn mark where he was scaled on his foot. The faucet on the shower where backwards and confusing you turn it one way and it seemed like you could not get the water to cut off.. THIS NEEDS to be FIXED this could be a possible law suit from somebody getting scaled small kid from not being able to adjust the hot water properly. After playing with the hot and cold water for -- mins I finally was able to take a comfortable shower. I was shocked tho that the whole weekend we never had a issue with hot water it was just dangerously hot.. Did not have a issue wit room service they came cleaned the room but they restocked the towels but where out of wash cloths ... Like how can you run out of wash cloths when I asked the maid said ask the front desk..??? No problem I normally travel with my own any way but I just found it odd .. Once again not shocked it was what I was pre warned about anyway overall this room served as my crash out spot to go to sleep in I am just kinda disappointed I am one who roots for the underdog this hotel is a underdog who keeps going under.. I have read review after review after review I have read the responses from management which are excuses PLEASE PLEASE Get it together...IF you need to shut down and do not reopen until everything is fixed do it or reduce the prices to match the quality this hotel is kinda rip off.. I repeat a rip off. Its a excellent location and has potential with the right person in charge of investing in the hotel it could be the - star that they false advertise .

At checkin they suggested a room on the top floor, Based on previous Tripadvisor reviews about the heat up there, we declined and got a -th floor inside room. Checkin with Emanuel was quick, smooth, and efficient. As it was an inside room, there was NO view, and very little light from outside. Too, there was NO noise from outside, which was nice. There was very loud noise coming from the pipes at odd intervals. It sounded a bit like someone was trying to break into our room through the floor with a cold chisel. This occurred every hour or two for a little while. Also, the bathroom plumbing would make noises at times. The bathroom was TINY, even by NYC standards. The shower hardware was not of high quality, and the shower stall, which was meant to have a sliding door, did not, so the bathroom floor was often wet. The room was tiny and a bit cramped (again, even by NYC standards) but fairly well appointed and the linens were of high quality and the bed nice.

It was around freezing outside and the room was way too warm, so I went to turn on the AC. I'm something of a gadget guy but still found the cheap controls grafted onto the old AC unit with an umbilicus to be a bit opaque. Finally I did figure them out and was able to cool the room down sufficiently at night. The AC was not too loud, and the hotel had installed a curtain around the unit to prevent it from blowing directly on sleeping guests. The amenities provided were of decent quality, but a toothbrush would have cost extra from the mini bar. The small fridge-mini bar was PACKED FULL of mini bar stuff, and we were barely able to wedge a couple of small things inside for our own use. The fridge didnt make a sound. Lighting in the room was ample, and the towels were of high quality. Checkout was quick and seamless. We stay in NYC often, and I feel more than qualified to evaluate this property.

Our room as well as the entire hotel was beautifully decorated and had a personal touch. The owners of this hotel did an impeccable job! Every night we enjoyed ice cream in The Crosby Bar down in the lobby and each morning we had trouble leaving our hotel room because it was so amazing.

Though we brought our own cigars had I needed one they had a nice selection that would make most anyone happy.

I hate to give four instead of five stars but, to be honest, the room was really very basic, & very small, with two double beds.

The woman that checked me in late at night was rude. Now she wasn't overtly nasty or anything, but she just lacked any form of personality. She never smiled once, nor did she welcome me to the hotel.
The rooms have just recently been remodeled, and while they have clearly spent a lot of meny re-doing the rooms they missed the most important part - THE BED! Its quite funny especially because these days every hotel has a really comfortable bed. The bed here at the Holiday Inn is AWFUL! Its your typical old-school hotel bed.

The bathroom counter though is great. The counter is much higher than normal and this is so much better for tall people like me!

id80800,"My wife and I stayed at the Drake over a weekend in February. There were some very good aspects, and some very disappointing ones.
First, the good ones:
-We had a room on the --th floor overlooking Lake Michigan. It was a beautiful view!
-The room was large and nicely furnished. 
-The Drake Brothers restaurant was excellent for breakfast - great food and great service. And we got a $-- per person voucher for being Diamond members. (Yes, you do need the whole $-- each!)
-The location of the hotel is great. In addition to the view, you can easily walk to many shops and restaurants. You don't need a car to experience this part of Chicago. We took a cab from the airport ($--). After our two days at the Drake, we simply walked across the street to the Hertz location at the Westin and rented a car for the rest of our trip. That allowed us to avoid the $-- per day parking fee.
-There are several great shops in the hotel. The Mangel Florist shop provided a small bouqet of beautiful red roses for only $--. There was an art gallery with beautiful paintings and a very freindly owner. Don't miss the Lavazza Coffee Shop in the shopping area of the hotel - great coffee, super friendly service (translated: not snooty - see below), awesome sandwiches, and a relaxing atmosphere.
And now the disappointments:
-The executive lounge is closed until """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""late March"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" due to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""lack of business"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". So definitely don't pay extra for a room on the executive floor hoping to use the lounge. As noted above, the substitute breakfast vouchers work well for breakfast. But check your bill - we were charged for breakfast the first day.
-The lobby area is undergoing renovations and much of it is covered with scaffolding and giant sheets of plastic. I notice that's disclosed on their website now, but wasn't when I made my reservation.
-The Palm Court Lounge was a disappointment on Saturday afternoon. We did not feel welcome at all and the staff was quite snooty. We got up and left and had a wonderful time in the Lavazza Coffee Shop. I'd recommend the same choice for others.
-Check your bill closely. We were charged for breakfast one day when it should have been free, and were also charged for some mini-bar items. And that was before I even realized there was a mini bar.
-The bathroom was small and in need of updating. I guess at the end of the day, an old hotel is still an old hotel.

id80815,"We booked three nights at the hotel via Priceline, so perhaps we got a crappy room because of this. I have no idea. I just don't understand how our experience was so much worse than most reviews. 
The good: service was excellent. Everyone with whom we interacted was top notch. They also provide bottled water daily in the room's fridge Both a plus. The location is also great, but there are so many comparably priced hotels nearby that Back Bay's location can't outweigh what it lacks. 
Our room was incredibly small. There was only enough room next to the bed for one night stand. It was also SO dark. This, though, is certainly a room location thing, so I'm sure not all have to endure the cave that was our room. Adding to the cave-like feeling was the terrible cooling system, which others have noted. Our room felt damp. Gross. 
The beds have a satin-type coverlette, which I immediately removed and shoved in the closet because I doubted it was laundered. Maybe I'm wrong, but after being stored in the closet for three days, the closet smelled filthy, like dirty laundry. Gross again. 
Our bathroom was adequate, though small. There was only one robe, which was fine by us because the one that was there was tattered and frayed. The worst part was the shower floor's tile grout. The perimeter was off-white, but the center was dingy brown. I'm sure it's been cleaned, but it looked filthy. 
And if you stay here, don't plan on coming or leaving too quickly. There are two tiny elevators (that honestly fit no more than - ppl). We spent one morning waiting five minutes to leave our floor. 
The whole stay I contemplated if I would write a review and then I asked for a coffee maker and knew I had to write one. For whatever reason not all rooms have coffee makers. Guess that's not a luxury all visitors get. We planned to depart early, so I asked for a coffee maker. I could have received one if I paid --.--! THIRTY DOLLARS! Since it was -:-- pm, I would have to pay the fee. Give me a break. I was even willing to carry it myself. The woman at the desk did seem embarrassed by the policy and reminded me of the coffee bar that gets set up at -:--. Too bad the morning we left it still wasn't ready at -:--. 
If this place weren't billed as a quality place, I wouldn't bi$@h. Honestly, I wouldn't. We paid a pretty penny for our stay. I have stayed at nicer Fairfield Inns than this place. What a rip.",Edge,Mobile
id80816,"We stayed here - years ago. However things have changed. Do not stay here! 
This is why: 
We arrived jet lagged and were booked in easily and professionally. However, on arrival to our room, next door were getting ready and there were allot of young people around very noisy, so we asked to change rooms. This was done fairly quickly. We arrived in our new room (double, on check-in we were told there were no doubles available) the draws were broken, the bath enamel worn away and the sink consol chipped (bare in mind this hotel has been recently refurbished) we were tired and were not planning to spend much time in the room so stayed put. At around -am a party arrived next door. Again we were in a connecting room. Very noisy so did not get any sleep. The same happened the next night, so had to move rooms again (you would have thought the hotel would have told them to be quiet) Third time lucky we specifically asked for a non connecting room and this was much better (although the draws were still chipped and we had no small mirror or room info book in this one!). Cannot comment on the restaurant or other services as we did not use them. Overall I would say unless you are in New York to party till late with the best of them and don’t mind shabby fixtures & fittings, (hotel is not well looked after at all) you'll be fine here - If you want value, respect and a good nights sleep.... really believe me.... don’t stay here! We wish we hadn’t!! oh ps its true about the lift - almost every time we got bashed by the doors! Oh and read the small print before you order room service......... costs a fortune!

We also enjoyed room service at the hotel during the evening and the food was delicious.
Our room was spacious and very comfortable. We had a great view of the city and the beds were great! They offered fresh fruit-infused water in the hotel lobby and the manager was there to greet us every time we walked in. 
My only complaint would have to be parking. I do not love having to valet park every time I leave. But, it wasn't all that bad. They do not make you feel like you have to tip them every time. They were very friendly and willing to help. Right after the race, my husband was just running up to the room to change very quickly and coming back down to the car to go into the city. We explained this. They kept our car right outside the door. It was not a problem.

id80826,"After reading some of the reviews I was a little worried about staying at Paradise Point. Many reviews had stated that the rooms smelled musty and weren't clean however we found that our room was clean and smelled fresh which I must admit I was relieved about. We had a 'Parlour Suite' which had a king size bed, a sofa queen, a small dining table and chairs, refrigerator, sink area, a vanity area with a wash basin and separate bathroom-toilet. The room looked as if it had been recently painted and gave the feel of a beach house.
The resort just needs some TLC - the lagoons were rather dirty, full of bird feathers and debris and the main swimming pool, although well used, never really looked clean and did not entice you to go in for a dip. There were a lot of birds about and obviously where you have wild birds you also have bird poo and plenty of it - everywhere!! The birds were very off putting around the 'Barefoot Bar and Grill' as they used to land on the tables and finish any food scraps before the servers had time to clear the tables. It was unhygienic and unpleasant as they came swooping in and landed on the next table.
The food at the 'Barefoot' was Ok but on the expensive side for what you got. The breakfasts were a real let-down after having been to the Mirage in Las Vegas. The 'Baleen' was more upmarket and although expensive the meals we did have in there were excellent. 
Tennis. bikes, croquet, putting, boats, jet skis etc were all available but were very cost prohibitive.
My son is -- and did not want to go on the beach but had he been younger I would not have wanted him to play on the beach as both the sand and the water looked dirty. Not the pristine white sands that the brochure describes.

We woke one morning to find that not only did we not have any cold water (both taps were coming out hot) but what water we did have was dark brown!
We called down to enquire why this was and was told that they had changed boilers and the problem would be sorted out within a few hours.
We went out for the day expecting the water to be normal when we returned in the evening. We were going on a dinner boat cruise so wanted to get back and get showered ready for the night.
The water was still the same. Dark brown and STILL no cold water. We went down to the bar, WITHOUT a shower, to have a drink before setting off out. Whilst we were both visiting the bathroom the barman took our FULL drinks (although he knew where we were going & that we were coming back) and threw them away! When I commented on this I was ignored by him! This resulted in my having to make a complaint to the hotel manager.

We booked a corner king with balcony, we found it to be bleak to say the least, there is nothing in it, a bed, - chairs, coffee table, stool, lamp. There is no decoration, at all. For storage there was a wardrobe with hanging space and nothing else. No desk, no drawers, no shelves, no suitcase storage. In the bathroom, hardly any space round the sink, we were here for a week and could not stay here. We upgraded to a suite at a cost of $-- a night. This was better as there were two wardrobes one with shelves, the living area was a reasonable size, bathroom the same small size, bedroom so small there was barely room to walk round, at my side about -- inches.
The views however are great, you do get a lot of flat roof, but from the suite, windows were North and west facing so we could see the Empire State building and Chrysler building, even from the loo! The views are what people go here for.
There were some really odd ideas though, There were no bedside lamps, no bedside tables, the bathroom cut the suite in half, tucked in a corner you could have had a magnificent space. There are floor to ceiling windows, but most are frosted, below the waist, so sitting down you can't see out! The curtains are so long that they have had to take a portion of the bedroom to hide the drawn curtain behind, about - inches along one wall. The yellow bathrooms are hideous, and the glass tiles in the shower floor get very slippy. There is no magnifying make-up mirror and no mirror at the desk to use as a dressing table. The wardrobes are in the small corridor between the bedroom and living area , they don't open flat, so to unpack I had to put the suitcase on the sofa and constantly open and shut the wardrobe doors to get back and forth, if I was trying anything on my husband had to stay put, he couldn't get past. The full length mirror was the most unflattering I have ever experienced.
Mini bar hideously expensive, the worst I've come across. Apparently all prices in bar and mini-bar have been recently increased. Two vodka and tonics at the bar $--, plus tax and tip. The restaurant dinner we had was standard American fare, nice, nothing special, it has changed recently it is Levant east not Thor now. Room service was fine except for a very overcooked bit of Salmon. Breakfast is very basic, but well worth getting up for, no OJ, just tea coffee, cereals, fruit and bread.
Nightclub is obviously not hip any more, we found it staid and we are in our forties, it was a deathly experience.
The area is good for bars and restaurants, but the streets are in a dreadful state in the area, not dangerous just broken and grubby, we much prefer, Greenwich. Soho, nolita and the west village.

id80900,"This is a great place to stay as far as location to all the historical parts of the city and I wonder if this fact made the staff feel they didn't have to be very friendly on a busy -th of July weekend. The doormen and bellhops were great, and the concierge never stopped smiling. But the front desk staff never looked up when talking to you. When I went down after our first day and said we didn't have any cold water in the shower, the front desk person mumbled something about calling the engineer and never made eye contact. The first night there, we stopped for a cocktail after dinner and asked the bartender to put the drinks our our room bill. He came back and rudely told us our name didn't match our room number. We politely told him we had checked in that afternoon and he left in a huff, never to return to ask us if we needed anything else. The housekeeping is another story - OMG! The first morning there they tried to come into our room at -:-- a.m. while we were still asleep. Luckily we had the door guard on as they tried to come crashing into our room! Now fully awake - we got up and my husband went downstairs to the fitness center. Just as I was stepping into the shower, housekeeping returned and came back into the room! I yelled """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Who is it?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" thinking it was my husband who had forgot something, and she yelled """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sorry"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and hurried out of the room. After that we made sure to put the privacy sign up when we were in the room. And we noticed everyone on our floor had their privacy signs out as well so I assume they were having similar problems. Also, they didn't replenish the coffee each day, there was stagnent water in the ice bucket when we arrived, they left pillows on the floor after making up the bed, and I accidently broke a coffee cup which they never replaced. So, stay there for convenience but don't expect any special treatment especially if it is a busy holiday weekend.

Also, I may have been more comfortable spending this much if the hostel had a very central location, but it does not.

Upon arriving at this hotel at - p.m., we were advised that check-in is at - p.m. We returned at that time and were advised there was no room available. This same problem affected a number of other people in our group, some of whom were not offered rooms until - p.m. or later. Absurd excuses were offered for this, such as that they should have arrived at - p.m. 
The first room we were offered was totally smokey, although this is billed as a smoke free hotel. We returned to the front desk. The second room we were offered was laid out as follows: There was a queen bed with a television stand at the base against the wall with doors on the front. Inside these doors were the only drawers in the room (this was the bureau). However, the television stand was so close to the bed that the doors could not be opened. Thus, no functioning bureau. One can only imagine who laid this out. When opening the door to the small bathroom, there was a new sink that had been put in with a wooden frame. The frame of the sink extended across the doorway approximately --- the distance and against the toiled on the other side. How this passes fire codes one can only guess. There was no closet in the room, just hangers in the room, similar to a Motel -. Bottom line, absurd layout and various unacceptable arrangements. 
We had booked for about --- per night, plus tax, for four nights. We jumped on [--] and selected an anonymous four star hotel in the neighborhood at $--- per night. Once we had bid, we were advised this was the W on the lakefront, three blocks away.

Incidentally, the W is more like a five star hotel and the regular rates were in the neighborhood of $--- per night. Meanwhile, the Best Western billed us one night despite their promise and a personal visit to the hotel for a refund netted a nice conversation and no action. Still, we saved money.
Bottom line, check Hotwire for options in the Streeterville area, which is where this is or Miracle Mile area. Avoid this Best Western if you possibly can, but if it is the cheapest you can find in the area, go with eyes wide open. It is -.- stars at best. Perhaps -.",InternetExplorer,Mobile

fine,i accepted it was what it was a rq and this obviously on this occation could not be fullfilled.
she advised that the sofa was in fact a sofa bed so - of us would have to sleep on that.
I advised that there was no linen in the room so could they at least bring that and make up the bed for us??!!!
They brought the bedding(which consisted of - sheets and a itchy blanket!)

We decided to stay downtown to be next to the wedding and couldn't be happier about our decision! From the minute we pulled up to valet to the minute we departed we were provided OUTSTANDING service!
Nicholas in particular has an above and beyond personality! He made us feel comfortable with his sense humor and knowledge. Two other associates Ashley and Brandon were extremely friendly and helpful with my requests prior to and during our stay. 
The location is truly one of a kind. This building was formerly the historical bank, San Diego Trust and Savings. This Courtyard by Marriott has done a fabulous job by keeping the structural design in tact and actually embracing it. This is what makes this hotel such a one of kind. My father owns and operates a commercial and residential construction and development company. I couldn't have taken him a better hotel as he in particular took to the beautiful and unique architecture. 
I stay at many different brands of hotels. This is an example of why my first choice is to stay at Marriott. It is not just because I can stay on a more than reasonable rate, but because the service and environment are consistently amazing. I have had my fair share of experiences that were subpar, however for the past year or so, Marriott continues to be provide the incredible service that we all desire and expect during our lodging experiences.

Rooms are OK, well decorated but the towels weren't really clean. The pillowsheets weren't clean either. So bring your own sheets or towels. 
Anyway, location is just ok. Just between Hollywood and downtown. Make sure you rent a car when you're visiting LA.
You have a free parking space and the price of the hotel is really OK. You won't find this quality anywhere else for the same money.",Edge,Tablet

That being said, the room was very nice, the bed awesome, and the staff accommodated our request to be adjacent to the couple with which we were traveling. AND, as they knew this was a celebratory trip, a bottle of sparkling wine and fruit plate was in both our rooms upon arrival. The guys at the door -David in particular-are awesome. Helpful and congenial, they went out of their way to help at every opportunity. The lobby is a bit small and lacks seating that invites lingering. The bar is the same.

Our accommodations were actually two adjoining rooms -- with two bathrooms (a very nice touch so that we could get ready simultaneously). One room had couches and the other the bed, but both had TVs. There certainly was some wear, but not bad and the rooms were well-maintained. I'll grant you that for this up-graded suite the price was not cheap (approximately $--- including taxes), but it was an experience to savor -- including a very comfortable bed. My biggest complaint was the price of drinks in the bar downstairs: if I remember correctly, $-- a drink for simple fare, not complicated cocktails.

The bathroom was contemporary and large and there was a good closet with lots of shelves that made it easy to store clothes. The safe was happily at eye level, rather than requiring crouching down on the floor as I so often find. Most importantly of all, despite the incredible bustle of Times Square, the room was completely quiet (I was on the --th floor, facing north). I slept very well. The biggest bonus was the free continental breakfast, served each morning in a pleasant area on the second floor overlooking the lobby. It was busy but never so full that I couldn't find a seat. A great selection of everything, completely self-serve. There is also a small bistro-style restaurant attached, which I tried once for lunch and found to be excellent. I hadn't stayed in the Times Square area before, but I would definitely consider it again if it could be at the Pearl.

The minibar in the room was fully stocked, as was our fridge. However, you will find that going to the Rexall Drug Store down the street will save you quite a bit on food and other items. The close proximity to the Beverly Center was a plus as well -- about a - minute walk. Beverly Center features a number of stores on four floors, and also quite a few fast foot restaurants on the top-most floor. 
There's no DVD player in the room -- just a TV-VCR unit. However, they allow rental of a handful of movies from the front desk (didn't use). The room itself was very clean and to our surprise, classical music was playing each day we returned from our sightseeing adventures. The chocolates on the bed and the weather forecast for the next day were also a nice added touch.
Breakfast was great with plenty of items to choose from -- bagels, cereal, milk, orange juice, pastries, coffee and toast. Free wireless and wired Internet usage was a bonus.
The staff at the Elan were very friendly, from greeting us to ensuring that our taxi service arrived on time (they yelled at them a couple times on our behalf). They offer a private, executive car to local attractions and the airport. Taxi service will be cheaper in almost all cases, unless you want the added foot room and luxury.

I started to get some clothes on but then noticed I didn't hear any other guests getting up or in the hallway. So, we called down to the front desk and asked if we need to evacuate.....they said no and it was a mistake-test that the alarm went off. Well....that alarm went off until -am!!!!!!!

I usually put the do not disturb sign on the door but I forgot. I let he know we would be out by Noon. By --am the fire alarm was going off again!!!!
In any case, as I checked out I complained about the fire alarm and they seemed unphased by the fact that it went off.

OK - so its not super chic, or ultra modern, but if you want a good reliable place in a good area its a winner. 
It's huge strength is its location - its - mins walk south of central park, right next to the MOMA - so only -- to -- mins walk down to Times Square if you don't get distracted.

There's also PJ Clarkes and PJ Carneys within fairly easy walking distance.
All in all, wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
One final point, the yellow cab drivers seem to have picked up an annoying (and actually illegal) habit of casually asking you where you want to go before they set off - DONT let them do this - just get in the cab and tell them where they're going - they really have no choice.

The room had a desk, a flatscreen television, a refrigerator and a microwave.

Check-in & Reception:
Staff were welcoming, and check-in was smooth and efficient. I was offered a complimentary bottle of water on arrival. I went up to my room to find that my room keys would not work. I had to travel back down to inform the reception that my card reader was faulty. They subsequently called the engineer who was rather intimidating as he checked that I was """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""able"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to figure out how to use the room key correctly. In actual fact, the battery in the card reader needed replacing, so was told to return an hour later (this was at --.--, and was already quite tired from my journey!!). 
I then spent my time in the hotel bar, where I felt the staff should have offered me a complimentary coffee or snack whist I waited for them to fix the defective card reader, but was not.
Room: 
The room was larger than I had expected; I had ordered the small room, and given that rooms in New York tend to be small anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. I was not disappointed with the decor; it was contemporary; with tones of mocha and cream. The bathroom was relatively large and well stocked with Aveda products. Despite the pleasing aesthetics of my room, there were a couple of annoyances. My room faced the rear court-yard, so not a great view, but I had expected that. More troubling however was the constant noise from the air conditioning unit (which continued even when I switched it off) which made it hard to sleep on the first night. I however had got used to it by the next night. Also the main parts of the room were clean, however noticed some traces of dust on the skirting and on the ledge of the wardrobe.
Dining:
Breakfast at the hotel was fabulous; There was a lovely ambience, with background light jazz music playing. There was a limited range of foods (bagels, muffins, fresh fruit juice, toast, cereals, yoghurt coffee etc) however it certainly hit the spot, and staff were very quick to replenish items. A great place to sit back, people watch or read the newspaper over breakfast. If you are a solo traveller, it is really easy to chat to fellow hotel guests as this hotel does not have the feel of the larger hotel chains.
Location:
Really central location, walkable to Grand Central station and Times Sq. The metro is a short walk away.
Concerns: 
Apart from the initial problem with getting into my room (defective card reader), I had a really pleasant stay. I did not want to stay in a large-chain hotel which is very samey (i.e. you could be in any country in the world and not be able to tell until you stepped outside), but this hotel had a lovely ambience, and being a solo traveller wanted a centrally located hotel. In addition, it is really easy to chat to fellow hotel guests at breakfast due to the nature of the lay out of foods and seating etc. 
Other: 
The free WiFi is a bonus.
Overall had a very pleasant stay at the Mansfield. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for a short break to New York. It is probably better for younger couples or independant travellers rather than for a family break.",Firefox,Tablet

id80966,"My wife and I stayed here for - nights recently and thought all the core categories - service, room and amenities of this hotel - were all fantastic. Definitely amongst the top tier of the other hotels we've stayed in Manhattan; comps being St. Regis, Peninsula, Four Seasons, and Mandarin Oriental. Certainly the Setai's vibe is much """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cooler"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" than the others but certainly not as obnoxious as say the W Hotels. I would say this is a high-end contemporary, appealing to the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""trendy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" crowd in the --s and --s vs. the W Hotel which is more in the --s. 
The more minor gripes:
* Power outlets in the room. Amazingly, there were very few and it's not as business user-friendly as I would have thought
* Construction behind hotel. Definitely a little noisy at times from Mon - Sat during construction hours and this is unfortunate which the hotel can't control
* Area of town - while -th Ave is quite nice and convenient at various stretches, the area where the Setai is located (between --th and --th St) is somewhat remote and not really """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""nice"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (e.g., in the high --s - low --s St) or more convenient (e.g. low --s - high teens). I'd say the mid --s St is the no-man's land and once you get to --th St, that's the annoying tourist area by Macy's. 
But aside from the minor gripes above which is quite immaterial, this is a fantastic hotel. Would definitely recommend this alongside any of the top-tier comps discussed above.",Chrome,Tablet

id80968,"We recently completed a --night stay at the Palmer after winning a Priceline bid. After Priceline announced the hotel name, I read nearly all of the Tripadvisor reviews about this property. Several of the experiences that you may read below are simply the result of timing. Each property also has positives and negatives which are NOT the result of timing. Here are a few for the Palmer…
Cons:
* Some of the rooms are quite small.
Many of the older style bathrooms have little standing room.
* Because it is a historic property, some facets of the hotel will show its age.
* Because of the dense urban location (no fault of the hotel itself), you can expect the following: even self-parking is expensive; only the top rooms facing the street have any views; beggars are common.
Pros:
* The location is indeed excellent – close to transportation, tons of restaurants & shops, theaters, the lake, Grant Park and Millenium Park, the museums, etc.
* The beds are wonderful – down-filled toppers both above and below the main sheets.
* Not just the main lobby, but all of the public spaces are beautiful (for example, check out the grand ballroom).
Tips:
* Before booking your stay, become a “Hilton HHonors” member. There are some perks including a separate check-in desk.
* Request your room preference before you arrive.
* If your room preference can not be guaranteed (as with Priceline), arrive early on your check-in day to request it in person.
* Before booking, check with the hotel regarding any overlap with major event dates (such as conventions).
* Leave a note with your tip for your maid.
* If it’s an option for you, visit without a car.
* As with any hotel, avoid the mini-bar. Buy your drinks and snacks at street level.
Overall, we were highly pleased with our stay. Of course, as mentioned above, many of these factors may have been influenced by the timing of our visit.",Firefox,Desktop

My experience was actually pleasant, the room was clean, the evenings were quiet, and the vibrations from the trains could be felt but nothing too bothersome. I am a light sleeper but didn’t need the earplugs or CD that they furnished to stay asleep. Since it’s a part of Union Station, it does have a unique charm and interesting architecture. My room was very close to the gym, which was equipped with a couple cardio machines, a weight machine, but no free weights. I would recommend staying on this side of the hotel. The hotel is located across from the ice arena and easy walking distance to all the downtown attractions.

id80981,"This is perhaps the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in but I'm not a big traveler. My -- yr. old son & I had a room in the Tower Bldg. whose rooms are recently renovated. The hotel also has rooms in the Atrium Bldg. The rooms are nice and just above average with double sinks & granite vanity tops in the bathroom. I always think the bedding @ Hiltons is comfortable.
We used the Spa (next to the Tower Bldg.) quite often which had an indoor lap pool, a whirlpool, & dry sauna. The men's locker room has solid oak wood lockers and an area for about - people to sit to sip free coffee and watch the large screen TV. The Spa also has a Basketball Court, Fitness Room, Jogging Track above the Basketball Court, Racquetball, & Squash Courts. Outside are Tennis Courts and a large sized Outdoor Pool with swim-up bar plus another whirlpool. The bar was only open on the weekend during our Sept. stay but is probably open daily during the peak summer months. The Atrium Bldg. also has an outdoor pool which we didn't use. The Hilton Anatole is on -- acres so it also has outside walking tracks. None of the areas were being hardly used by hotel guests.
We mostly ate @ outside restaurants so I can't comment on the food or prices. A Rathskeller downstairs had a bar with bar food and a pool table.
The lobby areas are huge and luxuriously decorated with large sculptures and large wall hangings. The hotel is defitely designed for business conferences.

id80998,"Just returned from a few days at the Homewood Suites in Chicago. My wife and and I were both in Chicago on business, but we brought the kids and extended it a day to make it a mini-vacation. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel. Location and value are great, but the staff are what really impressed me. The physical plant itself had a few flaws, but nothing major. Some details:
Location: The hotel is north of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The Loop,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in the North Bridge-North Michigan Avenue. It's hard to find a better location for tourism or for business (at least if business is in the downtown area). It's within easy walking distance -- i.e., less than a few blocks -- of some of the city's best shops and restaurants. The Navy Pier and lakefront is a slightly longer walk. A subway stop is down the street -- you can take it all over the City and (sometimes with bus) to the big museums (Field, Aquarium, Science-Industry). 
Value: The North Bridge-North Michigan Avenue area has a ton of hotels. We found this one hit the sweet spot of offering a lot (free breakfast and manager reception in the evening, suite-style rooms, nice quality) and affordability. 
Staff: I was really impressed with the quality of the staff. We had a problem with our room when we arrived: When we tried to open the sleeper couch, it couldn't unfold all the way because a piece of permanent furniture was in the way. (I guess nobody had tried to use it before.) We called the front desk and, within - minutes, a maintenance worker was at our door. He quickly rearranged the room so that it fit fine. The doormen-valet were beyond friendly -- they remembered my kids' names and were extremely helpful with directions, etc.
Downside? The room itself had what seemed like a less than optimal design: Lots of room around the kitchen, a small living area (and the aforementioned issues with the sleeper couch). The pool looked *really* old and dingy, although I understand they're about to renovate that. 
Internet speed was adequate but not lightning fast -- so if you're going to be streaming, etc., you might have some issues.
Other information: The breakfast buffet was standard-issue for this kind of hotel: Eggs, waffle maker, fresh fruit, cereal, etc... Parking is expensive in Chicago, so you're advised to buy a room package with parking if you're bringing a car. (It'll be cheaper.)",InternetExplorer,Tablet

id81000,"I stayed here for - nights with a friend on a girls shopping trip to LA. Front entrance has four or five staff on arrival but they are more interested in parking cars than helping guests in and out of the hotel with luggage. Likewise we walked across the road to hail our own taxis every day. I get the impression the staff work for tips and if you aren't waving money at them they are not helpful. We booked the room through an online booking agent and were unable to stipulate we needed twin beds. However our reservation did not stipulate we had booked a King bed room. This arrangement has never been a problem when I have travelled to other hotels (especially --- star places) who always accomodate by providing a twin bedded room when requested on arrival. Not so the Sofitel. The hotel was not busy but the receptionist advised that they had allocated us a Deluxe King Bed if we wanted a bed each we would have to pay an extra -- dollars a night plus taxes. The room was not cheap to start with and this guy seemed to think it totally reasonable that we share a bed. I found the attitude of this member of staff dismissive and irritating. No effort was made to call a supervsior or to accomodate us. It was take it or leave it. In the end we paid the extra as we had already paid the website in full for the room and only had a short time in LA. The staff in general seem to pose areound the lobby in stylish black outfits. The service lets this hotel down but otherwise we went on to have an enjoyable - days in LA. The room was a little pokey but had nice decor, nice robes and Loccitane toiletries and it was very clean.

My friend used the laundry service which was fast and she seemed happy but it didn't come cheap as there was even a charge to bring the laundry to the room. There are - macs with free internet access in the lobby and the concierge will check you in on flights and print boarding passes. Be warned whilst they have Tmobile wifi there is a signifcant charge to have it in your room. Based on the cost of the hotel I would expect wifi to be free. Would I stay there again? Maybe; if I couldn't find an alternative because of the great location and I did get great sleep however I would eat out and use the hotel's chergeable facilities as little as possible.",Mozilla Firefox,Desktop

We loved the rooms - it was well appointed, comfortable and so chic. The staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly. We ate brunch at the Woodward, which was delicious (try their drinks!).

From the front desk to the valets and bellmen, the service staff at the Hook and Plow - this is an exceptional group of employees who continually went above and beyond in order to assist me with whatever I needed. They helped straighten out check-in and room receipts for - different rooms on my bill, as well as packaging and sending my laptop to me after I had forgotten it in the room on check-out. I had a small gathering in the restaurant on Friday evening and this waitstaff could give other hotels lessons in how to serve a large party at this type of gathering. I had a large package to take across the street to an event at Bell Harbor and they arranged for me to use a bell cart briefly to get items to my room. The valet parking, though expensive, was always prompt and courteous so it made the cost less bothersome. I love the proximity to the elevator on Lenora St.(?) that takes you up to the downtown street level. 
The food at Hook and Plow was great! (Plus they gave us a couple of sets of silverware to take to our rooms when we asked for them.) The Eggs Benedict I had for breakfast one morning was good, but pricey. Still, great service, right down to one of the chefs who came out to make sure we were enjoying our meal.

I went for the absolute cheapest rooms at this, the absolute cheapest place to stay in Seattle (short of a flophouse). The $---a-night room with no bathroom was fine: spacious, quiet, and sanitary. TV and sink in the room were an unexpected extra at these rock-bottom prices. The shared bathroom just down the hallway presented no problems, and housekeeping kept it clean enough.
And of course, you can't beat the location -- two blocks from Pikes place, walking distance to just about everything.
Parking isn't provided by the hotel, but there's plenty of parking lots-garages within one block.

Our room was plenty big with a tiny kitchenette. The children had a sofabed and my husband and I had a wonderful separate bedroom with a king size bed. There was a bath that had two entrances, one from the living area and one from the bedroom. The counter space in the bathroom is very minimal but there is storage space so you can put your things away when not in use. Besides having the sofabed in the living area, there was also a small dining table. The kitchenette was very small but served the purpose. There is a wonderful market just one block over, Fairway Market, and on a few occasions we bought food items and we were able to eat in the room. The building itself is very charming as it is a converted pre-war apartment building. The staff was helpful, too. We arrived at the hotel on the first night at -:-- AM and they already had the sofabed made out for our children. The mattress in the bedroom was absolutely heavenly; I slept very soundly each night. The location is wonderful as there is a subway station four blocks one direction and three blocks in the opposite direction. I felt perfectly safe walking to the market alone or with my children. It is a very residential area and it was a treat just enjoying the beauty of all the different old era buildings in the neighborhood. There are several family-run shops as well as chain stores, such as The Children's Place and Gymboree.

We had no complaints about it whatsoever. The rooms were of a very high standard. Plenty of room, with a King size, comfortable bed. The bathroom area was spacious, and the cleanliness could not be faulted. Any requests from housekeeping were dealt with immediately. We did not use the restaurant, preferring to eat locally when travelling. In this regard the hotel is well situated, with an Irish Pub-Restaurant which was a really fun place about two blocks away. The Hotel is also only about a -- minute walk from Union Station, where all sorts of food is available in the Food Court.
Capitol Hill is very close to the Hotel, and it is easy walking distance from the Smithsonian Museums. Apart from that Washington is quite a sprawling city, and to go to a large part of the other attractions requires travel by cab, underground, or best of all the Hop-on Hop-off bus.
The Hotel staff were extremely helpful, and the Concierge could not do enough for us.
An added bonus was the roof top pool and bar, which had confortable recliners around the pool. In the Washington heat (-- degrees when we were there) the pool at the end of the day was very welcome.

The Bad:
The fan noise is really annoying. The HAC noise is made worst by the fact that there isn't a temperature control. I can't remember the last time I've been to a -+ star hotel that doesn't have climate-temperature controls.

The guest room looks like something out of architectural digest -- great in pictures, but not so great for real human beings.

This isn't to say The Clift doesn't have anything going for it; the bar is swanky and entertaining, and I've eaten at the Asia de Cuba at the Mondrian in LA, and the food there was good. But the Clift is one of those hotels that makes a better side trip than a principal destination. 
My advice: stay at the Hotel Monaco next door, and journey over to the Clift one night for drinks.

As for the rooms, they are both cute, neat, and bizzarre, it will depend on you. The bed was comfortable, and the room was quiet - just luck on that apparently.

My parents were with me for the weekend and actually checked in a day prior. My mom gushed about how friendly the checkin staff had been (I had called ahead to the hotel to let them know it was my parent's wedding anniversary that weekend). 
This is a very trendy hotel and not for people that are looking for an elegant, traditional decor. That being said, the hotel is quite nice - the rooms are extremely spacious compared to a hotel like the W in Manhattan where for a comparable price you barely have enough room to open your suitcase.
The room I stayed in had a nice view of Bryant Park and the ice skating rink that they had set up for Christmas. There is a hip bar in the basement of the hotel that is lively on the weekend, young crowd with a DJ and a line to get in. We spoke to the manager in the lobby and he graciously let us head straight into the bar bypassing the line.
The only negative to the entire stay was when we first arrived and unloaded the bags out of the rental car. I just wanted to leave them at the hotel so I could then drop off the rental car and head back to checkin to the hotel without having to drag the bags with me. The bellman was a bit rude, making a point that he was going to be off the clock by the time that I returned and hinting obviously that he wanted a tip.

id81086,"Here is my story. I travel on business a lot so I have a great deal of experience with hotel around the world. I always stay at the Four Points LAX when I am down in the LA area. It is clean comfortable and close to the Freeways to get to where you want to go. Let’s face it; you have to drive to where you want to go in LA. This time I had not stayed at the Four Points LAX for about a year. I arrived without a reservation and approached the front desk agent. I remembered him from pervious stays. Now here is the incredible part, with the thousands of guests that they see every week he also remembered me. Not just that but he remembered my favorite room. Wow! After a --- mile drive I was tired and did not want to go anywhere so I went down to the hotel bar to get something to eat. The waiter also remembered me and brought me my favorite Germen beer. On a side note the hotel bar, Brewster's servers an incredibly large selection of beers from around the world. Ask for the beer menu, it is broken down by country of origin. The restaurant is currently being renovated but you can still get anything off the restaurant menu in the bar. The food is very good with large portions that could easily feed two. 
What makes this hotel stand out is the incredible staff. I often travel to LA on business and to visit relatives. Over the years I stayed at many of the hotels around LAX (and there are a lot of them). They are all about the same, as far as room size and amenities go. The Four Points by Sheraton LAX sets it’s self apart by providing excellent value for your money and an absolutely incredible staff. The entire hotel staff display a true Aloha spirit. Every staff member that I came across, from maintenance worker, to house keeper, to concierge, to desk agent all greeted me with a smile and salutation.
What I look for in a hotel is clean, comfortable and affordable in that order. The Four Points Sheraton LAX has all of that and a friendly staff. They have all of the amenities that you could want including a welcoming pool, room service and free in-room wireless Internet. If you are looking for a great value for your money this is the right place to stay. It is my only hotel in LA. 
Thank you Four Points LAX for taking care of me again.",Firefox,Mobile
id81087,"I picked this relatively hotel due to its price and proximity to the Longwood Medical Area. I was pleasantly surprised by almost everything at the hotel. There is a Green ‘E’ line trolley stop very close to the hotel that makes it easy to access the rest of the public transport system. There are also buses (#-- to Back Bay station, and #-- to Harvard Square) close by. There is pizza, Asian food, and Subway available within a block or two, open to -am. 
Arriving after dusk, I didn’t get a very close look at the building exterior. The lobby is small but the staff is extremely friendly. Check-in and out was a breeze, although the hotel was rather busy and there might be a short queue. There is a cleverly named Brew’ens Café offering hot and cold drinks, snacks, pastries, and Greek yogurt -- hours a day. One would need to sit in the parlor, though, since there is maybe room for - people at max to stand in the area. 
My room was a comfortable double on the middle of the first floor. The ceilings are high and the color scheme gave a modern but warm feel. The beds were very comfortable although if one is short or has mobility issue they might be a little tall. The bathroom was on the small side, but brightly lit and very clean. The fan for the bathroom was on the loud side. There was only one chair in the room to go with the desk, whereas a double would probably benefit from another chair. I appreciated the complimentary wifi and the hotel’s efforts to recycle with separate bins in the room. 
Others have commented on the noise. As a city person it didn’t bother me, but on the first floor I could hear an occasional car passing at night. The front of the hotel faces a wide residential city street; the back faces a small highway.

Staff friendly and really tried, but kinks had not yet been worked out. For example, day of graduation when we were running a bit late, valet brought our car, but failed to leave the keys and vanished, causing undue stress for our family. There was also a windstorm which knocked out the satellite TV. Certainly not the fault of the hotel, but this was in the thick of the world cup and our family are huge soccer fans. We were not able to get proper information about what was going on, or when the system would be back up. Everyone we spoke with had a different story. We were also misdirected as to where we could catch the games-sent to an ESPN Zone down the street which was closed etc. Nothing major, but if I were paying rack rate, I would not have been happy.

Breakfast: food is good. But the air condition is week in the dining room. You can feel that yor clothes are smelling. Staff is very kind indeed.
Room: we were staying -adults and -- months old little one. Our room was seeing the city view. Although It was located near elevator, we slept like babies:) only the sound of minibar can be heard but not a big deal.
Room is kept clean but not as it should have been. When we told that sheets are not changed although we had left the card on the bed, the manager kindly apologized and provided us a free breakfast which worths $-- without hesitation. They have indeed have a good complaint management.
Just a suggestion. Try not to eat all the time in the hotel. It is quite expensive. There are good places around where you may get the same taste.
Dinner: there is no place to eat in the hotel but strongley recommends Brendans Bar and Grill. Guests of this otel has a discount.. They have a vey kindly staff and gine food.
The only problem might be the elevators. During rush hours as the hotel is busy, it takes time for the elevator to come to your floor and takes time to go down as it stops a lot. But to be honest we had this problem only once during all our days. 
As a summary it was a vey nice hotel. Worths for the money paid. Strongly recommends... Enjoy:)",Internet Explorer,Tablet

The rooms were comfortable as they were - plenty of room, clean, good beds - but the upper floors were closed for renovation, so I guess they are upgrading the rooms, including flat-screen tvs.

We did hear some voices and noise coming from the hall, but we just put some extra pillows up against the bottom of the door and turned on our white noise maker that we always travel with, and it wasn’t a problem at all. We never heard any voices coming from other rooms. As far as the freeway traffic noise that someone mentioned, you can hear it when the blackout curtain is open, but whenever we closed it, we never heard any traffic noise from outside. I’m assuming that this is because these blackout curtains are usually also sound insulating. We have noticed this in other hotels too.

id81116,"My partner and I recently spent six nights at The Prescott Hotel in San Francisco, CA. While our trip to the city was fantastic, we were less than pleased with the service provided from the lobby staff at The Prescott. 
On the best occasions it seemed as if our patronage didn’t matter to the front office employees, and on the worst we felt as if we were an inconvenience. I find this to be unacceptable from a hotel that claims to be of higher quality than others. We believe that since we paid for four-star accommodations, we should have also received four-star service. Unfortunately, The Prescott staff failed to meet our reasonable expectations on several occasions. 
 For example, we waited for the concierge to finish personal business before helping us purchase Alcatraz tickets. In addition, the doorman spent more time on his cell phone than opening the doors for guests. (We opened the door for ourselves at least --% of the time.) Similarly, the front desk workers seldom greeted us, as they were having personal conversations. 
 My partner is currently contacting In Touch because the gentleman checking us in told us that we were entitled to $-- of mini bar merchandise, however we were charged for the items because he didn’t add our In Touch number to the account. And finally, we were awoken at -:-- on Saturday morning (March --, ----) when construction began in the room one floor above us. There were two problems with this situation. First, we were never informed that someone was going to be moving furniture and carpeting in the room directly overhead. Secondly, it was very loud. Luckily, we were able to contact Delta to catch an earlier flight home. The construction seemed absolutely unreasonable. 
 When I travel I expect to get what I pay for which is the only reason I’m disappointed with The Prescott. Our trip was in no way ruined by the service provided at The Prescott, but it wasn’t enhanced either. I think these basic considerations should be addressed with the front hotel staff. I want to feel welcomed when I stay at a hotel, not as just another tourist.

id81118,"Park hotel is located in Union Square and very close to the Chinatown gate. It is close to shopping, convenient transportation (Bart-muni station is only - blocks away, plenty of buses on Market Street). The people at the front desk were extremely helpful, one of the managers actually gave me his bus transfer when I asked which bus to take to get to a certain location. I have never been to a hotel with such great treatment, even --- star hotes don't offer that warm of a welcome.
The rooms were very clean, I had plenty of clean towels that were changed every day, along with clean bed sheets. There's also soap bars, shampoo and lotion in the little cabinet above the sink, and the shared bathroom and shower room are very well maintained. 
A few comments addressed the issue of smell in the hotel, and I must say that when I first got there it also hit me, but I got used to it after the first -- minutes there and it did not bother me at all during the rest of my stay. It is not a bad smell, it's just an old building-disinfected place kind of smell, which is not surprising considering how old this building is. 
Although I was satisfied with my stay overall, I do have a couple of complaints. I was placed in room --- (I think) at first, and the tenants next door were being extremely loud. They were playing loud music at night, and one of them was arguing and yelling over the phone between --pm and -am nonstop, I could not get any sleep. I think these guys actually reside in the hotel. My first night there was horrible due to that, I was tired from a long trip and they would not keep it down. Considering that the front desk closes early, I was unable to complain until the next morning, so I had to tough it out with the noise throughout the night. I reported the issue the very next morning, and I was pleasantly surprised with how accommodating the staff were, and they gave me a new quiet room right away (room ---). They apologized and said they would talk to the noisy people, and I got another apology when checking out (from a different receptionist). 
This hotel is great considering its location and great service. It is a bit expensive considering that it is nothing too fancy, but that might also be due to the fact that I came on a busy weekend (Treasure Island Festival and Nike's women's marathon in Union Square were both taking place that weekend), and San Francisco is an overpriced city anyway. So I guess it's not that bad of a deal in terms of value. As a solo female traveler, it felt safe, hospitable, and I had no problem walking back to my room late at night, the area isn't shady (doesn't mean you shouldn't use common sense!). 
I would definitely stay there again in the future, and make sure I ask for a quiet room right away.",Google Chrome,Desktop
id81119,"I am a frequent visitor to Philadelphia and often stay at this hotel - although this is the first time that I have been there since they redid the lobby. The location can't be beat and I think the building and the rooms are generally attractive. I have a hard time with their deep bathtubs so I requested, and was given, a room with a walk-in shower (some rooms have both a shower and a tub, this had just a shower). The shower was a good size although the water pressure on the --th floor was weak. The room was small but nice - well furnished without many signs of wear and tear. My two complaints concern the food service, and they are not big, but they separate a good hotel from a great hotel, where at a great hotel any reasonable request should be accomplished. First request - dessert in the bar area. We asked for vanilla ice cream. The server said they had none. Finding this impossible, I asked would she please check. She said she was sure they didn't. We went upstairs and ordered it from room service without a problem. Even if there are two separate kitchens (which I highly doubt), they should have made this simple request happen. Breakfast the next day - I told the woman seating us that we were in a hurry, she said she would mention it to our server, but seated us without mentioning it. So I did. I ordered two plain bagels thinking that would be fast. After -- minutes of watching other people who arrived later get their food, the server came over to to say they had no plain bagels, so she was toasting a raisin bagel and it would be out soon. They needn't make a plain bagel suddenly appear, but I should have been told sooner that it was unavailable and asked what else I would like. It's small things like this that are annoying at hotels like the Ritz Carlton.",Mozilla Firefox,Desktop

id81121,"Spent Saturday night, Oct -- at this hotel. Granted it was Halloween weekend, -th Street was in high gear and UT home game. However, since the Hilton is billed as a ‘convention’ hotel, the staff and operations seemed like I was at a Motel - with -- rooms. Hotel has limited parking on site. I was not apprised of the expected overflow crowds for this weekend during my check in. When returning to the hotel early Saturday evening, I found the self- park and valet completely full. If front desk staff (or even parking staff in the UNATTENDED booth in the garage) took the time to make guests aware of parking issues, I would have planned accordingly. The only option was to use the convention center garage across the street, which does allow anyone to walk in off the street. Hotel did remove all parking fees from my bill and cover the $-.-- fee in the other garage. The front desk said they have enough parking for - car per room, clearly the hotel has no clue as to what goes on in its garage.
Too much noise from the rooms, had to call security twice during the night. Again, this is a college town and most likely many people find their way to the rooms of hotel guests. However, the hotel had no security or check points to stop non-guests from taking elevators up to guest rooms. Management did make adjustments on my bill to compensate for their short comings. However, the sense of out of control guests and no oversight of their parking confirms I will not stay at this location again. I should have figured something out when all other downtown hotels were booked for this weekend, except for the Hilton.",Firefox,Mobile
id81122,"We arrived at this hotel late at night and decided not to stay. It was a strange environment. I could see through the windows that there were fans in the rooms, which I took as a bad sign, ie that the a-c might not be working. The building looked very old and run down. There were a couple of shady drunk people wandering around (it was a weekend nite). And I noticed people kept looking out their windows for some reason. The area itself wasn't that great. There were a number of places that advertised the same or cheaper prices. 
I had originally made a reservation online. Fortunately they were kind enough to cancel (I had to call three different numbers and got lucky). I guess that was the only good point.",Edge,Desktop

There is a trolley stop right outside the back door and you are only a few blocks from Beale St. It was very relaxing to open our curtains and watch the trolleys and horse drawn carriages go by. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast included plenty of hot and cold items, including sausage and eggs. The pool area was nice and included a hot tub. There was also free wifi throughout the hotel. When in Memphis I will definitely stay here again.",Internet Explorer,Desktop
id81124,"We stayed in the New Yorker for one night on a business trip...and I probably wouldn't want to stay any longer. The rooms are small, probably big enough for just --- people who aren't looking for an oasis but a place to sleep after touring NYC. The bed was very comfortable but I thought it was strange that the blanket they gave us was so thing, so as a result we had to blast the heat on all night. Wasn't very impressed with the bathrooms. They definitely need updating and it gives the feel that no matter how many times you clean it, it still feels kinda dirty. It's definitely very different from any Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Marriott or Radisson I've ever been in. 
That being said, the location was unbeatable. It was a quick -- minute walk to Times Square, Macys and endless shopping is right at your fingertips. The subway is also just right outside the hotel making it super convenient. 
Also as a side note....as soon as I got into the elevator and arrived on my floor, I got this super weird vibe. If you've ever been on the Tower of Terror at Disneyland this is exactly what it looked like. Probably because the hotel is so old, but I definitely would be afraid of staying here by myself overnight.",Mozilla Firefox,Tablet
id81125,"It was my boyfriends birthday and about -- of us were going to the Padres game and heading to Gaslamp after, so I decided to stay at the Hard Rock because I felt it was appropriate since we were there to party. We arrived at -:-- (later than we expected), so we were in a rush to check-in, drop our stuff off and head to meet everyone at the Padres game. When we get to the hotel it seemed like the hotel would be awesome because we were greeted by super friendly valet staff. Our bags were picked up for us and when I was ready to check-in, I was told the room was not ready. The advertised time for check in is -:--pm and it is about -:--pm, so I keep my patience and was told it should be very soon that they are just finishing up. While we're waiting in the lobby, we figured we can't waste anymore time waiting on them we were about to head out to the game at -:--pm. However, as I was about to leave I received the call that the room was ready. We decided to go ahead and get settled as quickly as possible so we wouldn't have to do it when we get back. I finally got to check in at -:--pm (an hour later than the advertised time) and gave my ticket to the concierge person to get our bags up and she said they'll be there right away.

They still did not come and after another ten minutes I called back and was told the same thing. Finally, I went downstairs to make sure that they were not sitting in their holding area. Basically, my plans were thrown off an hour because of the hotel and this should have not have been the case. Half an hour was wasted because the room was not ready until - and another half an hour was wasted because our bags did not get there until -:-- and the game started at -:--; in addition, we had a lot of people waiting on us. For spending $--- a night this is not what I had expected nor wish to have experienced especially on someone's birthday. I could have stayed at a motel for this kind of service. Also, the bell boys were rude. When we initially decided to just leave to the game without checking in, we had to grab stuff from our bags and one of them had to supervise us. He had an annoyed face and was not friendly at all (I'm sure because we were delaying him from getting his tips from other people), but that would not be happening if our room were ready as advertised.",Mozilla,Mobile
id81126,"I've stayed at this hotel in the past mostly due to the location and proximity to where I'm doing business. However there are a few things to note. The front desk staff while they are friendly and accomodating do a quick --- if a phone call comes in and then you're second in line, wihch is annoying. The rooms are OK, but can use some renovating. My room had some cosmetic issues, like broken tiles in the bath and kitchen. the One bedroom suite has the queen bed crammed into a very small space. In addition I had one of the interior rooms. While it is quiet, you get absolutely no sun or sky view at all. What you do get is an alley view and another room directly across from your window. Not much to write home about. The couch has had better days; the cushions were shot. The person or persons who designed this building with the rooms situated as mine is obviously didn't care about what guests would want or desire. 
In addition note that valet parking is all this place has and at $---night its kind of a ripoff. But there really is no other choice unless you want to try street parking and risk getting towed.
As said earlier the rooms could use a renovation. In addition the A-C is very loud as is the refridgerator. Both seem to be on constantly. Not very environmentally friendly. 
The hotel maids are anything but quiet during the day. One afternoon I was working in the room and all I could hear was one mail screaming something in Spanish to another. What about the people who are sleeping during the day? I bet those maids wouldn't appreciate someone yelling outside their door while they are sleeping or working, no?
One more complaint and then I'll stop. The hot and cold water do not mix well when taking a shower. Its either scalding hot or cold, no inbetween. I'm not sure what thats all about, but at $----night it would be nice to get something inbetween, no?
Thats all. I'll end with this is probably the last time I'll stay here. Its time to find a hotel in Beverly Hills that actally lives up to the Beverly Hills name!",Edge,Tablet
id81127,"Christmas Road Trip Adventure!!
We were traveling back from Austin, TX to Orange County, CA, and told by family and friends NOT to stop in El Paso, that there wasn't any place safe or nice to spend the night, etc, etc.
Well stubborn us, we needed to find some place nice that had internet in the room for my wife to get some work done during the road trip and, and after some googling, we decided on the Doubletree Hotel El Paso Downtown-City Center, and boy were we glad we did.
Starting with a phone call to check availability and a quick transfer to their reservations line, I got a little frustrated with the agent before getting disconnected. We just decided to show up and book the room since it was a Monday night and they appeared to have plenty of rooms.
The hotel was easily accessible off the I---. Upon arrival and a quick trip to the lobby restrooms, our check-in at the front desk was very efficient, especially with the clerk finding my Hilton Honors account to help expedite the process. The warm cookies are always a nice touch.
Our room was clean and comfortable. View of the hillside star and a downtown X-Mas lights display was a plus. My wife connected to the internet no problemo and got what she needed to get done done while the kidlets unwound from the first leg of our return drive.
Room service for dinner was quick, with just one very minor error on our kid's order which we didn't bug about. Just make sure to double-check under each plate cover.
Time to crash and room temperature was very comfortable. Very restful sleep.
Checkout was easy, no errors on our bill. Starbucks in the lobby was a god-send for hitting the road and finishing last leg.

id81128,"I have stayed here a couple of times before with my wife. This time I was with a friend. We had - economy rooms. These were small,but very clean and comfortable. Apart from the bed which I found super comfortable, I notice that the TVs have been updated & there are now more channels available. This was appreciated when we got in early one evening.
This is an ideal place for those people who will not have a car. The Old Town Transit Station is less than - minutes walk away. From there you can get the trolleys and buses. They're fast, convenient and good value.
I love that this place, which has always been great, doesn't rest on it's laurels. They constantly make improvements, which although small, really make a difference.
All this and their really genuinely helpful and friendly staff, are what makes me come back everytime I'm in San Diego. 
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Old Town Inn.",IE,Desktop

We had to leave to our evening event so I never called again. Lastly, the room was not equipped with the sheets-blanket for the sofa bed. I had to call for that also.

id81130,"We arrived at Hotel Valencia around -pm on a Saturday night with no reservation. The front desk staff was extremely friendly, and we got a king room for $--- (we did talk them down about $-- from their original offer). The room was wonderful!! It had a modern asian flair. All of the surfaces were high quality and clean with a large flat screen TV. There was a hopping scene in the bar off the courtyard until --pm. Our room overlooked the courtyard which was crowded with people. We were just starting to wonder what time it closed when it promptly quieted and the courtyard was suddenly vacant. The noise from the bar scene was gentle, not very loud and not at all annoying. However, if you did want to go to sleep early it might bother you a little. We didn't mind it at all. We didn't hear any other sounds from other rooms. We were on the top floor with views of the beautiful pool and courtyard. We don't get out much and were amazed at the number of people walking around Santana Row during the evening. There are several restaurants and bars. It was fun to be reminded of how lots of people spend Saturday night out!
The next morning there was a very nice buffet breakfast next to the courtyard that was included with the room. Hot eggs, bacon, cereal, toast, coffee, etc. It was wonderful to sit in the sun in the courtyard to sip coffee and plan our day. 
The bed was extremely comfortable, well appointed and very clean. I love the down comforter with a sheet-duvet so there is no yucky bedspread. We were delighted to discover this wonderful hotel and plan to stay here again. Santana Row is a great shopping location and there are a number of restaurants to choose from. Even my husband had fun and he is definitely NOT a big shopper! We had dinner at Left Bank which was great (order the french fries for an appetizer!)
I would definitely recommend this as a weekend getaway. There is shopping during the day at Santana Row and across the street at Vanity Fair Mall, great restaurants and a fun night scene.",Chrome,Mobile
id81131,"Me and - of my girls stayed at the hotel's Quad buckbed room this weekend and we loved it! The hotel was clean, very close to Time Square and the subway. Room was bigger than I expected for the area, not saying it was huge, but definately bigger than others I've stayed in in that area.
Would make - suggestions tho... add a towel hook right outside the shower so its easier to access your towel after showering. And add an extra curtain (like the one for the closet) in front of the shower-toilet area so theres a dry space to get dressed after showering too.
But regardless... we loved it! It was just overall awesome!!! The staff was super friendly and helpful at all hours of the day-night... we really couldn't have asked for a better stay. Definately will recommend it and will definately be back!",Google Chrome,Desktop
