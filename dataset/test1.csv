Although the property displayed the AAA emblem, it certainly left a lot to be desired. There were chips & scrapes on the bottom of the door frame in the bathroom and the lotion containers were half full--apparently not replaced by housekeeping. We needed an early wakeup call, but couldn't use the clock radio alarm as there wasn't a radio in the room. There was no TV channel listing on the remote, or on the TV menu making viewing a chore.The TV remote had to be returned when checking-out.

Asked front desk for a local Seattle restaurant on my first night. She suggested two cookie-cutter wine bars and a mall restaurant. Not a big deal, but as I became familiar with downtown Seattle, I couldn't believe she didn't recommend The Brooklyn or one of the many other restaurants with true local flavor.

The air conditioner did not work and the heater was on and could not be turned off or adjusted. Althought it was cold outside we felt we were in a sauna and had to open the windows for air. We were told by the staff that at a certain temperature outside the air would not turn on and the heater would go on automatically.

The hotel is beautiful, very modern, stylish, with attention to detail. Our room on the -th floor was spacious, with great decor, hardwood floors, Keurig coffee maker, and floor to ceiling windows.
The bathroom was also big with a large shower. There was no tub, which was fine with us.
One of the best things - a QUIET air-conditioner! Finally something that didn't wake me up at night. Overall, the room was very quite despite the fact that there were occupied rooms all around us.
The staff was very pleasant. We asked if we could have a late check out at - pm. The gentleman at the desk graciously offered us - pm checkout due to our platinum status. It was perfect!
The restaurant downstairs in the lobby was nice, but doesn't really have much selection for lunch. The upstairs patio bar on the -th floor was closed for renovation.
The location is great. Within walking distance to Balboa Park (you can grab a free trolley once in the park), Seaport Village and of course Gaslamp.

I had a room on the --th floor. It was spooky. The --th floor is only half a floor, rooms on one side of the hall, the other side of the hall is roof. The hallway temperature was in the mid --'s. The building moaned with mechanical sounds coming, seemingly, from everywhere. More than once I was reminded of the movie Barton Fink. Ice machines are located on floors -, -, and -, however all of them were out of order. Ice was available in the lobby. 
The door from the garage to the hotel was un-locked at all times. See a previous review about the door being """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""broken"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The garage itself seemed dirty and dingy.

We had a room with a king bed, there was - of us, so I asked for a rollaway bed, $--- night.

What I considered a ripoff however was the $--- day we had to pay for internet, when these days most places now offer it for free. Not only that, but it was only good for one device! We had two laptops, so only one could access the internet on any given day.
They say the room comes with DVD player, well you have to ask for one, because they are not in the room. Also, the tvs are very old. I asked for a DVD player - different days before I got one, they have a limited number. There is no ice machine, and the vending machines are only on the ground floor. I called twice to get an extra pillow and gave up, never got one. We got two face cloths the first couple of days, one the -rd day, then none for the remainder of our stay. I didn't bother calling them after my other attempts. I just used their towels to wash my face.
And finally, I asked for a wake up call for the morning we were leaving for the airport, I was right in front of the guy at reception when I asked and saw him write it down. Thankfully I woke up on my own because they never called. So again I don't know if we were treated poorly because we were in a discounted room, or that's just the way they are.

After some research on Tripadvisor i had high expectations for this property and i was not disappointed. Only thing disappointing was that we did not spend a lot of time in the hotel. We had a - bedroom apartment and it was beautifully appointed with good size rooms, proper kitchen and laundry which was great, especially as we had been traveling in Hawaii for a week prior to SF and was then heading off to Ski Fields. 
The apartment was very clean and well looked after. 
Good location if your wanting to do the Tourist things near Fishermans Wharf. Take a tour of Alcatraz, the concierge got us tickets for the tour. If your wanting to do shopping then Union Square is the place to go. We took a taxi, the hotel has one courtesty car, however was not available for when we needed it, so we took a taxi for $-- each way. 
Breakfast was great, however for the price of the hotel, you would expect a full hot breakfast, the breakfast provided was continental, i did enjoy the fresh raspberries and blueberries on offer.

Most of the people in our group were children. The staff welcomed us (Thank you Gio) allowed us to eat breakfast and crash in the lobby until our rooms were ready. They got all of us in quickly and when our suite wasn't ready they gave us two standard rooms so we would have plenty of room for our family to be comfortable, at no extra charge. The location was great, right across from the Garden home of the Bruins, and we were there when they won the Stanley cup. Even though the game was in Canada the area was packed with excitment. We were excited to be a part of it all and became Bruins fans!
The Boston police did an excellent job of keeping everything under control. The hotel did an excellent job of handling the extra traffic and chaos too. The manger, Jamie, was very nice and gave ice cream and candy treats to the kids. The area did not seem bad to me at all. There are a lot of pubs in the area, but there seem to be alot of pubs all over Boston.

The lobby was lovely and the desk staff very helpful, professional and friendly. The beds were comfortable with clean sheets and plenty of pillows.
The Bad: The rooms were indeed small. The bathrooms were snazzy with marble tile floors and pedestal sinks BUT there was no place to put ANYTHING - including your toothbrush and even shampoo. Perhaps adding a shelf beside the mirror would help. It was a hassle to have to have to constantly unpack your toiletries for every single use. Also, the Wi-Fi connection in the lobby was spotty and did not work in the room at all despite my willingness to pay the daily fee, a real problem if you need to do work. 
The Ugly: The room was never cleaned. When we first checked in, I found beer caps on the window sills. The second day, I came back to find a giant wad of used towels on the floor next to the bed - not all of them ours! The third day, I returned to find the contents of the coffee maker soaking the table top. And on each day, the maids showed up at -AM. Once, they actually walked in while we were still sleeping?!? 
And a word to the wise, get there early for check in because the Inn “routinely overbooks.” We watched two people get turned away despite having reservations. Good luck finding another room during convention season.

Although I have been called a snob, I like to think I have a taste for the finer things in life, and have a healthy discrimination against hotels that cost an arm and a leg, but do not deliver. On the other hand, I have a special appreciation for a place that lives up to its expectations. The Royal Palms in Phoenix is such a place. From the minute we pulled up in our rental car, till we pulled away four days later, we were treated as VIPs. You can tell the staff at the Royal Palms enjoy working there because they always have a smile on their face, and they never give you the begrudging response I have received at other hotels when asking for this or that. The pool is immaculate, pool bartendars fun and energetic, great workout facility, great location, incredible food, and fantastic spa. I loved my room and did not want to leave.

The receptionist offered me ear plugs! I suspect we were kept on the bottom floor because we had the Travelzoo special rate for - nights. The bottom floor, which is actually the second floor, is very noisy from traffic on the Bowery. The trucks even shake the hotel.

All this means we slept very poorly. The room itself is nice enough, large, clean, and new. The hotel is a block from the subway, which is very convenient. The continental breakfast is unimpressive. The hotel was a good deal with the Travelzoo special rate, but I wouldn't stay here again at the regular rate.",Firefox,Mobile

In addition to the stylish comfort of the room, I especially appreciated the little amenities that seem to have evaporated elsewhere, even at fairly pricey hotels: free fitness center and pool, free bottled water, real cream with the in-room coffee set-up, a mini-fridge that is not an electronically monitored mini-bar, and free wireless internet--one that doesn't even require entering a long code in order to access.

So to enjoy the DC area we booked the hotel by naming our price on Priceline. We ended up booking a $--- rate! Trying to book on the Crowne Plaza website, they are demanding $---+, which all value is lost for that amount. 
It is older, which means everything is smaller, but still it is a beautiful hotel. The service was top notch through out minus the belle service.

The front desk agent upgraded our room view to look over the park and Washington Monument. He also told us a little bit about the area. The concierge was very friendly and graciously helped us out on dinner reservations one night. 
The rooms is somewhat tight but not too bad. The rooms are well appointed with iPod dock, safe and black out curtains. The bathroom is extremely tight. It's not possible for two to get ready in their bathrooms, even thought it is smartly designed, still too small. 
The Hamilton has a great bar just off the lobby with a few TVs to catch the games. There is also a Starbucks attached for those that need their daily fix. This location is a busy one on weekdays.

I had a very comfortable king-size bed, plus a desk, desk-chair, comfortable chair for reading, flat-screen television, free wi-fi, air conditioner, and the best lighting I have ever had in a hotel. The bathroom was small but clean. The room looked out into a courtyard and was very quiet.

id80225,"We have patronized a number of Joie de Vivre hotels and this is the most upscale, with a full service restaurant.
The building itself looks a little incongruous being in a cylindrical configuration and is in somewhat of a no man's land. However, it is well served for road access being next door to entry and exit ramps for I--- (there is construction at the interchange which effects traffic patterns, and one ramp is closed at nights).
The room was above average size with a comfortable king bed, work desk, full length closet and a mini bar - refrigerator. There was both WiFi and Ethernet complimentary broadband access in the room; the WiFi was satisfactory but I couldn't get the Ethernet to connect. The desk surface was large enough to be able to work comfortably on. Although there were numerous power outlets in the room few of them were convenient to the desk. There was only one useful outlet close to the desk, near the floor. Under the desk there was an additional outlet but hidden behind a rats nest of communication wiring. We ended up with devices on the bedside table and in the bathroom in order to charge them.
The bathroom was large with a single sink, toilet and shower. The shower was a walk-in type and looked as if it could have been converted from a tub configuration. Water pressure and temperature was good. Lighting was fluorescent but was adequate.
The room provided an ironing board and iron, a safe (which I didn't' use), hair dryer and a coffee maker. The room overlooked I---, noise from which was discernible at night but not uncomfortably so. The air conditioning unit was more obtrusive, largely I think because I don't travel much any longer and so I'm unused to an AC unit.
The staff were accommodating, pleasant and efficient, Parking is complimentary but requires the use of a valet service, we never waited more than two minutes for our car.
Unlike other Joie de Vivre hotels we have stayed in breakfast is not complimentary. One can either use the restaurant or they have a cafe with muffins and croissants. We didn't partake of breakfast at the hotel so I cannot comment, although the cafe offerings didn't look particularly inspiring. We eat dinner at the hotel one night and it was excellent, much better than usual hotel restaurant fare and it was reasonably priced. Another surprise was that it was busy.
Although the hotel is somewhat isolated from services such as shops and restaurants, Brentwood Village is -.- miles down Sunset Blvd. and there is a sidewalk between the hotel and the village for anyone wanting a little exercise. In the village there is an excellent restaurant (Divino) and a cafe (Lu Pan Quotidian), also excellent and both worth visiting.

The area around the Marriott leaves much to be desired. Just a few restaurants down the street, and not much night-life to speak of. Just walking the block or so to get to a nearby brewery did not feel totally safe. There's a different vibe during the day and conveniently, there is a Metro stop not half a block up the street for ease of getting around D.C.

id80248,"While I live in SoCal now, I am a NorCal native and long-time resident. My partner and I decided to stay in the city for her birthday, and I wanted to find a hotel that wasn't the standard cookie-cutter major-chain type (although I am a rewards member of many). I don't even remember how I landed on the Hotel Vitale site, but I was instantly hooked. Reason: The Ferry Building. If you are a foodie, you KNOW already you're going to SF, you KNOW where you want to be on a Saturday morning, and this hotel is right across the street, poised in perfect striking distance. So I browsed the site, and was amazed that this little hidden gem was to be found. I booked one of the better rooms with a TERRIFIC view (room ---) and spa shower, and took the plunge with an open mind and high hopes.
The Hotel Vitale did not disappoint. From the moment we got there, the modern elegance of the property was wonderful. My partner was a little recalcitrant at first (as she put it, she could not think of a hotel that, on first sight, was LESS """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""her type"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""") but when we got to the room... 
I had advised the hotel that it was my partner's birthday. When we got in (very late Fri night), there awaited a bottle of champagne on ice...and not Cook's or something cheap, either! It was a very impressive bottle of Chandon Brut. accompanied by a personalized card for me from the manager, as well as a personalized card for my partner (from the housekeeping staff at turndown). 
We were worried about the minbar, because we intended to purchase food at the farmer's market-Ferry Building on Sat, and nosh on it throughout the weekend. Not to worry -- the minibar was NOT one of those electronic-sensor ones that charges your room if you just breathe on something...we were able to remove items to make room for our purchases, and then replace them when we were done. Housekeeping seemed to dig this immediately, as nothing was moved or touched in that regard. 
We ended up purchasing a lot of nibbles at the farmer's market- ferry building, and spent one night watching in-room movies while having a luxurious feast in a room that did it justice. 
These superior rooms do have a closet type armoire with a couple of drawers, as well as a small curtained off area for the ironing board and iron. The closet included two robes, and two COMPLIMENTARY pairs of slippers. Our bellman quickly rustled up two additional suitcase racks and set them up, so space was not a problem. The window-seat couch had a cashmere throw, and the bedding --- well, it was the best sleep of our lives, and I didn't want to leave... We received a card inviting us to a free yoga session if we so desired. 
There are complimentary """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Fresh"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" toiletries as well as overpriced 'honor bar' ones, which didn't impress us enough to try them. The in-room honor bar also includes Dean & Deluca treats, Scharffenberger chocolates, airplane booze, etc., and a clever """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""intimacy kit"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" package of *ahem* items in case you forgot something... They will give you either the NY Times, SF Chronicle or both, if you just ask. The papers arrive in a clever canvas sack hanging on your door daily. 
If you're worried about clanging maid carts or ice machines, forget it. This hotel is very retro euro-styled, in that you call down to the front desk for ice. The hotel is QUIET. We were overlooking the Embarcadero, right over the outdoor bar area, and noise never bothered us even late-night. We WERE able to open our windows to some degree.
The concierge was wonderful. If you ask, he will give you a canvas hotel logo shopping bag for your purchases at the ferry building. Something people haven't mentioned -- go around the back corner from the hotel bar, and you're at an F-line trolley stop, which gets you on board before the huddled masses at the Embarcadero-Ferry building sites. So if you are using the F-line, it is literally door-to-door service, you need to walk maybe --- block. 
We did not dine at Americano, but enjoyed several drinks outdoors. We did not use the spa, but the rooftop space looks wonderful. 
This hotel is not by any real means kid-friendly in and of itself, but they do have a nice kid's program for family travelers called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Kids are VIP"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", where the child will have a personalized ID card on a lanyard given to him-her on check-in, and the child is the one who handles all the check-in procedures, and they will make a kid feel special and important. 
I think the ONLY con about this hotel is that there are no bathtubs in the super-deluxe view rooms (you have to go to the highest-end room for that). I am a shower fiend (and the spa shower is GREAT but can be slippery after product use-- they do not have stall mats) and was quite happy with the rainforest-style shower.

DECOR: This hotel is done in an understated traditional style with Asian influences and antiques. I really like the hotel's style. I disagree with other reviewers that this hotel is dated. I think of it as well preserved and in my opinion, in a very good and charming way. It's like going to my rich aunt's house in the ----'s. The furnishings are, at first glance, not remarkable. Upon further inspection, however, you're forced to admit that while not flashy, everything is tastefully done and of high quality. 
ROOM: I had deluxe bay view room one night and an executive king room the last two nights. Both rooms were wonderful. I'm not sure I'd pay the additional cost for the executive king, though. It did have a very comfortable couch, however. I love the featherbeds placed over the mattress - - great sleeping and lounging. Oh, the down pillows and duvet were very comfortable. I like the color scheme: teal carpet, cream walls, blue upholstery, crystal lamps, floral drapes, and Asian accents. My room was spacious, quiet, clean, and comfortable. I also liked the marble bathroom. It had a large vanity and closet. The airconditioning worked very well and kept my room comfortable.
SERVICE: Very good. Staff here is not as friendly as some of the other hotels I stay at, but they're never rude and are always helpful.
FITNESS CENTER: The hotel has a nice fitness center with great equipment. Most of the machines have individual TVs on them although I don't think headphones are provided - - so bring your own.
LOCATION: Wonderful location atop Nob Hill. Your within easy walking distance to Union Square, China Town, North Beach, and Russian Hill. The location affords some rooms outstanding views of downtown, Coit Tower, and the bay.

Our meeting took place on the second floor in the conference rooms. During a morning break I found a homeless person asleep in one of the stalls in the ladies room. I called the front desk and they escorted him out. There are stairs from the main lobby that anyone could take to get up to the second floor. The elevators require a room key to go higher than floor -. 
One of the nights we were there my colleagues were disturbed by hotel guests in the next room that were ingaging in loud adult relations. It was so loud my colleagues had to call the front desk to ask them to contact the room and tell them to be quiet. 
When we returned to our rooms one day after our meeting my manager's door was left open (by the maids?) with the door stop. Thankfully nothing was taken.
All in all it is a nice hotel. The food at BANK was excellent. We dined there for breakfast & lunch and were very impressed. The hotel bar used to be a Whiskey Bar, but the investors pulled out and now its just know as the Icon Bar. Its a nice bar but I think the cocktail waitresses outfits are a little bit sleazy.

The customer service has always been excellent. Check-in is friendly and efficient. The concierge and doorman are always helpful and friendly.
The rooms have always been very clean and in great condition. They are well-appointed. The bathrooms are nice and the bed plush and comfortable. 
If you can afford to upgrade to a river view, not only will you be rewarded with amazing views, but you'll be buffered from the noise of the trains (The L) that run right behind the hotel. The closer you are to the ground and the rear of the hotel, the more disruptive the noise, at least in our experience.

Cons: Parking is $-- a day, but I used priceline and the hotel cost me $-- all in per day. The location is on the Riverwalk, but Lexington Ave is the furthest Northern hotel still considered Riverwalk, so this could inconvenience those that stay out late or those out of shape.

id80265,"We held our wedding here last year. It is such a beautiful place to have a wedding. The pictures you see on their website are real--the function rooms really look like that, beautiful, opulent, like a fairy tale. We had an hors d'oeuvres reception in the Venetian room, which then opened into the Oval room, where we had dinner. We took pictures in their grand lobby, and most of the guests stayed at the hotel as well, as they offered us very good rates (almost --- the usual rate). Another friend got married at the Grand Ballroom, which is like a scene out of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Beauty and the Beast"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", but the room was far too big for us.
The food was good at the wedding, and the service was excellent. We asked them to raise the temperature of the room (b-c it was January), so everyone (mostly from out of state-country) was warm and cosy. The wedding coordinator was OK--she did everything we asked her to, and didn't miss anything, but she was so difficult to contact while we were planning the wedding. It seems she is overworked and has too many weddings-events to coordinate, but the least we expect from a wedding coordinator is that she reply to emails in a timely manner, which she does not.
We stayed at a suite, which was grand, large, and very comfortable. I especially like the large closets, the fluffy bathrobes, slippers, and the good quality soaps and shampoos (with cotton balls, and all amenities) in the bathroom. All the other guests seemed to enjoy their room too. 
For tourists, this hotel is centrally located in the heart of Boston, and is walking distance to lots of food, shopping, and sights. It's also right near a T stop (public transportation).

Here are the facts, feel free to make your own conclusions:
-. Check-in involved an uncomfortable ---minute interrogation with the manager about why I was in town and what I was planning on doing in the room. Even though it wasn't his business, I told him I was 'in town for the beach' and 'sleeping in the room'. 
-. The hotel lacked the proper billing paperwork from Expedia. Even though they had my reservation, they messed up the billing with Expedia and threatened to charge me again for the room if they couldn't work it out (i.e. punishing me for their own incompetence). Luckily, Expedia was helpful with this and the matter eventually got resolved.
-. A friend from La Jolla showed up to hang out with us at the beach during the day, and the manager yelled at me as we walked by the office because he saw - people although I only booked a room for -. Again, even though it was none of his business, I explained that our friend was just meeting us there and we were on our way to the beach.

The hotel offers a free shuttle that we only used once when the weather turned cold and windy for one day. Our driver was courteous and friendly as was the entire staff.

I don't get that about the people posting reviews on here about hotels. They come visit a city and spend most of the time complaining about how the paint was chipped in the corner by the door, WHO CARES??!. Anyway, we had a flat screen tv, which we watched a couple times, but like I said, we spent most of the time exploring the city. The room was a little bit too dim, but that didn't bother us much. The bathroom was a good size and we had everything we needed. The room was cleaned everyday and everyone was so helpful and friendly! Th beds were VERY comfortable-we had a good nights rest every night. Our view wasn't awesome, but again, we didn't care! It didnt make our trip bad in any way.

Panic ensued on both sides of the desk as the hotel was full due to lots of conventions in town. So, here is one of the big tests of how well a hotel is managed. A guest is staring, or more like glaring at the desk clerk demanding justice; and ya, I was that guy. Why should the desk fellow believe me? He could of just blown me off and said, 'sorry, you messed up'. But, it didn't happen like that. Turns out there was one room left with two queens and a foldout couch that could accommodate all of us. The clerk (wish I could remember his name), immediately booked us, dropped the rate, and gave us all breakfast vouchers. Whoa! 
Nice room, nice beds, typical bath, mini kitchen with micro and sink, small clothes space that allowed for kitchen, but it worked. Really clean. Okay, happiness was all around. The next morning two more interesting things happened. First, the hotel gave each of us gift bags with good chocolate and souvenir Seattle mugs, and showed us to our individual rooms that they cleaned up early. Whoa, again! (Oh, and the breakfast was great at the Emerald Grill). 
Then the students' flight was super late due to weather and it messed up the plan for lunch. The desk clerk saw our stress, overheard our conversation and invited the manager of the Emerald Grill to visit with us about making box lunches. I said we only had thirty minutes to which he replied, 'we can do that'. Thirty minutes later -- box lunches were done and on the bus, including drinks for $-- a piece. Whoa yet again!!

It stayed good. The hotel had our group keys all ready to go, everyone was treated very well, and we had two good morning breakfast buffets that were overseen with great professionalism and care by Sergio.

There are two large mirrors in the room which helped. Our room was cleaned each day while we were out and we appreciated coming back to a nicely made up room. Our only complaint was the cleaning staff threw away some souvineer water bottles we had placed on the dresser. I spoke with one of the staff the next day and suggested they should only throw away items that have been placed in the trashcan. She said they always throw away empty bottles. After that, we hid our bottles in our luggage! I appreciate the cost of a mini-frig being waived because I have medication which must be kept refrigerated. When I mentioned at check-in that I needed the frig, the receptionist arranged it and called me twice to make sure it had been delivered to the room.

id80310,"My cousin and I stayed here over New Year.
The 'el' was so close to the hotel, you can hear it. It's fine once you get used to it, but needs a little adjustment before you do.
Our room was lovely, mainly I think because we had a corner room which made it light and airy, with a view down to the lake. Also, because we had two beds, whihc meant it was reasonably sized. We heard a lady in the elevator complaining about the size of here room and when we went past a room beign serived and could see inside it, it did seem quite small.
The bathroom was good with great products, the bedding was lovely and the location was fabulous. Most things were well within walking distance. There are plenty of places to eat close by, so no need to starve here.
Our complaints were around the lack of... no kettle for tea or coffee making in the room. Why? And wifi was available, but at the most rediculous prices! It was something like £--.-- for basic (good enough to check your emails) a DAY or £--.-- for the faster stuff. As my cousin said - how come most of the coffee shops provide free access while you sip your $- coffee, yet hotels charging huge amounts of money can't offer the same service? I'd advise you to go for a coffee to check your emails! Our other complaint was about the pool area. the pool is TINY, no changing facilities and the jaccussi was out of order for our whole trip, which was rubbish. We were really looking forward to a nice soak after a lot of walking and were hugely disappointed that it wasn't in working order. 
That aside though, we had a nice visit. The hotel lobby is as amazing as everyone says - but all manner of people can wander in and out of the area unchallenged, so make sure you lock everything up okay. 
We recomend the gage, which is on Michigan Avenue for a lovely meal.

Upon our arrival things started on the wrong foot. I had requested a suite with a view and was informed those rooms had been booked and we would be located down the bluff a short ways. When I asked if we would still have a view I was informed that we would. In deed we did, of the main parking lot. In the evening if one leaned way out onto the balcony a thin area of city lights could be seen so I guess the statement wasn't totally untrue.
We found our room, with the aid of a map, and believe me when I say the parking is horrid. If you find a spot in the winding streets comprising the resort, take it, you don't know if you'll ever find another one.
Entering our room to be honest, we almost turned around and left. The rooms (suite) are extremely dated with old mediterranean colors and satiny cloth. After the shock of the old fashioned color scheme wore off we explored the room and found to our delight that it was laid out perfectly for and extended stay. The living area, bathroom and bedroom were very private from each area. Each person could move about the suite without bothering their partner. And of course they have the wonderful Hilton beds.
We did alot of sightseeing but still came back to the resort to take advantage of the great restaurants they offered. Choices were good and prices were reasonable

id80352,"We visit family in Indy at least once a year. We normally stay at the Residence Inn on the Canal, but last time my kids complained about sharing the sleeper sofa and asked if there was a way they could each have their own bed. We chose the Springhill because it was the only hotel we could find with - queen beds + a fold-out couch. Also, it is part of the Marriott family so we got half our stay free with loyalty points. 
The unexpected surprise was the stunning view of White River State Park from our --th floor room. It did remind me of the reflecting pools in DC and was especially gorgeous at dusk and after-dark. Our room and entire hotel had nice furnishings. The beds were comfy, even the fold-out, which was separated from the other beds by an opaque screen. 
The bathroom is split with a toilet and sink-mirror on one side of the closet and and shower and sink-mirror on the other side, both with sliding doors. This was very handy with a teen and tween girl. 
We expected a continental breakfast and were pleasantly surprised that the there also hot items: eggs, sausage, oatmeal, and make-your own waffle. The breakfast line could be better organized as the waffles created a bottle-neck, but that wasn't a big deal since we weren't in a hurry.
You can easily walk to the canal, State Museum, Etiljorg, NCAA Hall of Champions, Victory Field, canal boat and surrey bike rentals, and even a couple of restaurants.
The cafe at the Etiljorg was very pleasant with indoor and outdoor balcony seating overlooking the canal. Zoo and glass gardens with butterflies are maybe a - minute drive. 
The work-out room looks out to the small pool, which is handy for keeping an eye on older kids. 
Parking is $-- self-park and $-- valet and I didn't see any affordable off-site parking options. While it is steep, it is in line with other Indy hotels downtown. It was a little tricky for family members to find as there are many Marriott properties in the area and it shares a building with the Courtyard. A good landmark is that it is just past the giant red check mark sculpture. 
We missed the outdoor balcony and grill at the Residence Inn. My girls said that free cookies (like at Res. Inn) would have """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""enhanced their hotel experience"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". However, Springhill did offer free lollipops and free breakfast. Service was fine--no complaints. I admit Residence Inn was friendlier, probably since we have been going there for years and staff actually remember us from visit-to-visit. 
At the risk of seeming disloyal to Res. Inn, I think we found a new favorite.",InternetExplorer,Desktop
id80353,"I stayed here with co-workers because I recommended it due to TripAdvisor reviews. In retrospect, I was very embarrassed because the hotel was pretty mediocre. There is a Robert Earl Keen song that is called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""It's the Little Things"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the last line is: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""that piss me off."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Well, that's how I felt about this place...it was the little things. To summarize: 
Pros:
*Free Internet
*microwave-refrigerator-coffee maker, popcorn in room
*clean rooms
*safe in closet
Cons:
*Staff never communicated about anything
*Housecleaning would forget things like COFFEE!
*Loud highway noise, even if you are out in the middle of nowhere
To elaborate:
I showed up, requesting a King, non-smoking...I received - doubles and a smoky room, made evident by the fact someone had unwired the smoke alarm. It didn't make me feel very safe that it would be fixed the next day ( I checked in late). 
I ordered room service for breakfast twice, the first day it didn't show in the -- minute window and I called. The lady said she would call me back and right then, there was a knock on the door with the food. A total miscommunication, but no call back to apologize or anything. The next day, it showed up at the top of the -- minute window. On that note, breakfast was tolerable one day, inedible the next. 
The pull out desk is very cramped for doing work on a computer or eating. It basically bumped up into the second double bed. 
The SleepNumber bed is a glorified blowup bed. I didn't sleep at all. 
I had a housekeeping person practically barge into the room--there was one knock: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hello? Wait..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" from me (since I am still dressing, for goodness sake) and then there is someone coming in my room. She apologized a couple of times, but I was over this place and it just seemed like more of the same.
Started noticing the little things...I guess when you are mad, you notice things!--plastic """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tile"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in shower, loud noises in hallway, rip in comforter. It all started to build up for me.
When I checked out, I requested that my second """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""breakfast"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" be taken off the bill. I got the Spanish Inquisition about what I ate and when I ordered it (I had the feeling they didn't believe me), but they took it off the bill. Which I didn't look at when I left. 
Came home to Denver to find out that I had someone else's bill. They faxed mine to me (needed it for reimbursement) and told me that I had two reservations in my name. What?!
All in all, it was just so disappointing. I'm from N. Florida, so I was pretty let-down and embarrassed that I told my co-workers that this was one of the best places to stay for value and service. I'm leaving out so much other stuff because it's ticking me off to think about it!
I have to believe that there are other places to stay in Jacksonville that are a better value and don't cost $--- a night.",Safari,Mobile

id80357,"Recently stayed for - nights at the Hilton Gardens, Hollywood (formerly Hollywood Heights). Its a well located hotel, close to the the Kodak Theatre and Walk of Fame. The rooms were very comfortable and I think that the staff were the most friendliest that I've ever come across.
The hotel catered for meals but on the nights that we hada meal it wasn't that well attended - this was such a shame because, for a hotel, the prices were excellent and far cheaper that any of the other places that we went to. At night I like to have a proper meal rather than fast food type and we did find that it was difficult to find. As well as the normal menu the hotel did an offer of - courses for $--. This was excellent value and good food too. Also a bottle of wine was only $-- whereas in a nearby pub we paid $-- just for - glasses. 
I would urge anyone staying here to use the restaurant, I just wish we'd tried it earlier in the stay. 
There is an outdoor pool and spa which was pleasant. The only problem was that by mid-late afternoon most of this area was in the shade so after a day sightseeing it wasn't possible to then do a bit of sunbathing.",InternetExplorer,Tablet

The staff did tell us (after the fact) that for an additional fee they would guarantee us a room with a view - what a scam! Also, when we asked to switch rooms, they said there were none available. Lo and behold two minutes later when someone came in to ask about rooms one mysteriously became avaiable. To be fair, the pool area is nice, the location is beautiful, and the breakfast is good.

I have stayed in places with shared baths, etc. before so I wasn't expecting anything fancy by any means. I checked in and was taken to my room. I was shown several bathrooms I could chose from. Only was even half way usable. The others had huge brown rust stains and the ceramic-paint was peeling off. It was gross. The hallway was dark, big trash cans in the hallway and the floor was completely uneven. I already felt like I was in a horror movie. I am taken to my room. No light switch - just a bulb with a string in the middle of the room. No phone, no refrigerator, no heat! There was a huge waterstain that covered one wall from floor to ceiling at least half-way across the wall. It was patched with plaster and then repainted over but the plaster was just thrown up there in large chunks and was already beginning to crack again. The sink was sitting on an angle because the floor was so uneven. The carpet was old and dirty - didn't even look vacuumed. The table lamp also didn't work. The guy had to unscrew the lampshade and fiddle with it to get it to work. He looked around and said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""it looks fine, huh? Like its been renovated?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Ugh!! He left. The door - no chain, only a flip lock. I sat down on the bed and looked down. The bedspread was covered with hairs. I pulled down the cover on one of the beds and there was a huge stain on the sheets. I have no idea what it was and don't want to know! I started to freak out a bit, so I called my husband and asked what I should do. I pulled down the other bed covers and there was a bug crawling on the pillow!! I screamed. That was it. I had to go. My husband starting calling around (since I had no phone in the room, no phone book, etc) looking for another hotel. I went down to the lobby told them I couldn't stay and asked for a refund. I was denied only offered another room. No thank you!! I was really scared and just wanted out of there as fast as I could get. I swear I had the feeling of being in a horror movie. I wasn't taking any chances!! 
All that said - don't stay there!! I even checked out this website and read the reviews, checked out the pictures. I can tell you that my room looked nothing like the pictures posted here. The walls were dark yellow and the room was very dingy. Only the bedspreads were the same.",Firefox,Mobile

-) the extra $- for the safe can be waived, just ask. I got the explanation from other places: this is due to the fact that the safe boxes are rented from a -rd party.

The dressing area was right in front of the bed so if you get up before the other person the light shines right on the person trying to sleep. 
Going into the bathroom you could not just walk right in, you had to kind of step in a little to the left in front of the toilet and then open the door the rest of the way so you could actually get into the bathroom.
The pull out sofa bed was horrible for our son. It felt like you were sleeping on a ramp. You're head was up higher than the rest of your body. He actually considering sleeping on the floor, it was that bad. And when the sofa bed is pulled out it is very hard to get around the room since the armoire holding the TV is on the wall across from the sofa so you had very little room to squeeze by to get to the other bed and the bathroom.
