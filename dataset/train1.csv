id10327,"I stayed at the Crown Plaza April -- - April --, ----. The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving!

id10328,"I booked this hotel through Hotwire at the lowest price I could find. When we got there the front desk manager gave us a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""smoking"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room. I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.
After a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).
The parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.
All in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.",Mozilla,Tablet,not happy

All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.
The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.
I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.
Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay.

Overall, I'd recommend this place for singles or couples, but for children present, you probably need a bit bigger room. For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price.

id10338,"We stay at the Jolly Madison over the Xmas period, the main feature is it's location. You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.
Our room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.
We did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.
We took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.
Make sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.
The store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(
Stumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.
We did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.

id10345,"The service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. 
-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.
-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.
-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.
-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.
-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. 
-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.
Summarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

This property was a let down. Initially, things went smoothly. Check-in was fine, as a HHonors Gold member I was informed with an apology that they did not have an Executive Floor to upgrade me to, but put me in a - bedroom suite and offered me a complimentary buffet breakfast and the usual wifi vouchers. This is where the good things ended.
The room had issues. Initially, the phone in the living room did not work. They sent someone up to fix the phone, and then some --- hours later it just started randomly producing high pitched beeps (which in turn woke me up). In addition, the guest compendium was empty (as in someone had removed the pages). It took - phone calls and - people to come up to my room to actually understand what I was requesting, and deliver a full compendium.
I also had cause to contact and visit the front desk at various stages later in the evening during my stay. To say the night staff were next to useless would be an over-statement. The night manager basically said nothing to my requests, or as little as possible. They treated me like I was putting them out of their way and disrupting them being lazy. One particular staff member was so bad I wrote a separate complaint to Hilton about them.
I also witnessed a lady in obvious distress attempting to get a room late one evening. When they informed her she was not able to get a room without photo ID she became upset and aggravated.

id10348,"I very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...
I'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.
The pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.
We headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.
We headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.
I've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.

We chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.
The furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip.

The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. 
The Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) 
Overall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!",Firefox,Desktop,happy

We had read about slow parking valet times, but our waits for the retrieval of our car averaged two minutes! I suppose if you wanted your car during intervals of high turnover (check-in and check-out), it might takelonger. I suggest you ask the valet staff if you are concerned.
Back to the hotel room,we specified a room with mountain views and got a nice one. Large large bathroom with separate tub and bath appointed with marble floors and granite countertops. rooms facing west in the summer, you might want to leave your AC a little lower before you leave for dinner.

id10362,"I stayed here last Thursday - Sunday. I attended a business workshop on Friday, and my hubby and I stayed through the weekend for leisure. Check-in was smooth and fast, and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. 
On the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.
Other positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant.

id10364,"My first stay at a Kimpton property was on a Friday, for a business trip in DC. I booked a room at Donovan House with - criteria in mind: location, and value. The location of the hotel was convenient, as it was near the National Mall and government offices but also within - mile of several other points of interest. I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio. It's not scientific, but based on the feeling of, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""did I get a good deal?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The first impressiom of the services was upon entering the parking garage. Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.
Upon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----.

The hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh.

The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold.

We were blown away. I've stayed in Manhattan more times than I can count - this is by FAR the best hotel experience I've had (sorry Ritz.)
We were upgraded to the Penthouse level (yay Hyatt rewards program!). Oh-em-gee .... a roof patio! The room was gigantic - especially by NY standards. The lounge is awesome and I'm in love with their espresso machine. The concierge was very helpful and we had a few ideas where we wanted to dine the last night and Eataly was great experience.

Most of all - the staff went above and beyond. Jordan was so awesome - he handled our check in (room wasn't quite ready, so he had us relax in the lounge while he handled check in) and he risked life and limb during an epic thunderstorm on our -nd day to score us a taxi to get to an appointment on time.

Oddly, about - floors' worth of the soda machines didn't work. We reported it to the front desk.
The parking situation was weird, since it doesn't belong to the hotel, I think. Hotel guests park on floors four through seven of the garage off to the side, but it seems to be event parking as well.

(Tip: Listen to the SD natives who kind of look askance when the idea of visiting Old Town is the topic. We didn't take their advice and ended up being seriously underwhelmed by Old Town and its surroundings. Instead, visit Coronado Island if you have a free afternoon during your conference. Those few hours along the beach and walking through the town on a sunny afternoon were the most memorable and pleasant of all during our SD stay.) I would recommend this hotel to friends only after it finishes renovations.",Edge,Desktop,happy

The concierge tried to rip me off on a ride to the airport and when I questioned her overpriced quote, she told me that if I didn't like it, go ask the doorman for advice on car services.
One elevator was out of service, yet they didn't tell me that when I made the reservations. I had this problem once before during holiday time with a NY hotel, so had I have known, I would have made other accommodations.
One night, there were dirty towels or something left in the sink by the housekeeper that day, who obviously was in so much of a rush, she left the items in the sink. Disgusting.
When I made reservations and then when I checked in, I asked for a room with a view. My view was the back alley next door. Bait and switch.
The hotel room and whole hotel is shabby. I tried to move out to another hotel the day I checked in, but being Thanksgiving week, it was hard to find other accommodations since the city is full. I got a survey from Affinia a week later, when I told them of the rude staff, rude concierge and lack of services they said they would make it up to me. They lied, They gave me nothing and ignored the problem. I will avoid all Affinia Hotel's in the future. They don't care about the guests at all.",Internet Explorer,Mobile,not happy

Service: There could be more front desk staff.

Food: the continental breakfast was fantastic and was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel. The continental breakfast offered nice variety and the fool was delicious. The woman who tended to the breakfast was friendly and efficient; she provided great service.

I travel to NYC quite a bit for business and pleasure and I have tried them all, but this will be my new home away from home.

id10423,"My stay at the W City Center was a Dr. Jekyll- Mr. Hyde type ordeal. For every task that they did well, there was an equal and opposite task that flopped. 
As a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from - stars to - stars. And, lately, I have been having good, solid experiences booking - star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline, but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck.I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect, but I was wrong.
I rated my experience at the W a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but it was closer to a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-.--"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and just like in math class, I rounded down. I am not sure what the exact criteria is for star ratings, but for service, the W City Centre is a solid """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-.-,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but that's as good as it gets.
My flight landed at Midway at about -:-- am, so I took the Orange line and arrived at the hotel at around --:-- am. I was expecting to check my luggage, but to my surprise I was able to check-in. And, according to them, they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the --th floor, so that noise from the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""L"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" wouldn't bother me. What a joke!!! 
My bed wasn't even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don't tell me it's an upgrade, when it really isn't. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison.
The room was tiny! After I learned was staying at the W, I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small, but the website doesn't do the room justice. There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair. At -'-"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", --- lbs, I'm not a huge man, but it was a feat for me to do that.
The television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed, so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it. And, the question that kept running through my mind was, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""If this is a - star hotel, where is the plasma TV?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I have stayed at many other - star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TV's in it's rooms. 
I liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables, it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room. But, it was a too small for my laptop.
The bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""debris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once. I mean it's so loud, the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night.
The service at the door was great, but it came in spurts. At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door, but at others there might not be any, only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and he's busy, then you're stuck! I didn't see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically.
The location is decent. You're very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and - or - blocks from the Red line. And, unless you're going out at midnight, like we did, there is usually a cab in the vicinity.
Overall, this is not a - star hotel. You either have great service or none at all and I didn't appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit.

ONLY NEGATIVEs:
-. Rooms are a bit small for this price range, but very clean and nice, and the location of this hotel is amazing, but you pay for it.
-. One night, Sunday, I went to the pool (around -pm local time) and the skimmer-pump was turned off, so the water was stagnant and kinda cloudy. I don't know if it was just bad timing, but it was a big turnoff. Otherwise the facilities are very clean. If the pool is open til midnight (which is generous), keep the pump on, please.

It is also right in the middle of the marina with boats and beautiful views in every direction. 
Check in was quick because it was late night. Got upgraded as a SPG member even though I was paying a very low rate. The room was bigger than average because of the curvature of the room. Exceptionally clean with --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" flat tv and nicely decorated. King bed was big and comfortable. I only heard one plane before I dozed off, but the room is sound proofed well. 
The lobby is bigger then most hotels downtown. It has a great social-computer center with free Internet and computer use. There are two restaurants and two different bars, and a full service Starbucks. Although the prices for food in the bar were high, I think they are on par with most - star hotels. While the menu had some high priced items, there were many items in the $----- range. 
Although parking is $--, this is the same if not less than what many - star hotels charge downtown. I have paid as much as $--. 
Since there are dozens of hotel choices in the downtown area, this hotel only makes sense for me if I don't need to get around the city.

My room also had a patio which would be a nice addition for the Summer months. Some very important advice is that there is a railroad track that runs adjacent to this property. If you are a HiltonHonors member, you are given to option to select your room before you arrive. Rooms on the South side of the property and on the East side of the property are ones to stay away from if you are a light sleeper.

It also appears that the bed sheets have improved---they are a much higher thread count than what was there previously.
So...how is it slipping? The furniture is starting to get shabby. The hotel is only - years old but hotel furnishings seem to take a real beating. The granite countertop on the kitchen table had some indelible stains. However, what really got to us is this --- everyday the towels and wash cloths smelled unclean and were dingy.

However, when it's a time of day when most people are out, it's really inexcusable. Speaking of the plumbing---the toilet often had to be flushed twice---not good!
We never experienced these issues during our last stay two years ago. What's up with that? Is the hotel cutting corners when it comes to properly laundering the towels? Are the plumbing problems being worked on?

In addition the door onto the corridor was close to the neighbouring rooms and I could hear them come and go too. This room is convenient for the lift being just around the corner but also able to clearly hear conversations of people getting in-out of the lift saying good bye to friends etc.
I was staying at this hotel for one night only and so didn't ask to swap rooms. Also the noise did not become apparent until mid way through the evening. It got a little quieter later in the night but I could have done with a long restful sleep in preparation for my transatlantic flight the next day.

On the other hand, there were many many issues. First and foremost, our bathroom flooded. It happens. They were quick in fixing it but it's still an issue. They also forgot our towels one day, though they did deliver new ones upon being told. Their website was also very inaccurate as it advertised free wireless internet in the common areas despite there being no such service. On top of that, they lacked a book of amenities in the room and did not provide one; being hungry at - AM and wishing for room service or some sort of map, we were unable to procure one. The website was also very unhelpful, lacking hours and locations of things. Finally, it seemed that getting a card remagnitized without all four cards there would reset all cards and prevent them from working, meaning that by the end of the trip, we had only a single working card and no real means of obtaining new working ones. 
The neutral in this case was the room situation. We had - people in a room, one of which did not wish to share the bed and as he was paying, one had to sleep on the floor, me.

So far so good but the building has an immense problem with noise exposure. The rooms are extrem clairaudient.

id10498,"My son and I stayed here over spring break. I got a room here at a very good price - almost as low as the cost of a nearby hostel. The room was very clean. I read a few reviews that said the rooms were small, but considering the size of an apartment in NYC, I didn't think it was that small. We had two double beds, and if we had been traveling with a third person, we probably could have squeezed in a rollaway bed. The bathroom was very clean and looked like it had been recently updated. 
A couple of cons - there was no screen on the window. We were on the --th floor and the window opened all the way, but there was no screen or any other safety feature. The bottom of the window is about -.- feet off the floor, so I kept having panic thoughts of my son (who was -- YEARS old at the time) tripping and falling out the window...a little paranoia there. lol However, I would not recommend this for someone traveling with a small child. Also, I could have sworn the rooms were advertised as having air conditioning. This one did not. I'm guessing they put window units in during the summer, but since it was still March, they hadn't put them in yet (it was unseasonably warm while we were there). That's just my guess, anyway.
The other thing that was a little odd was that the door lock looked like it had been broken before. I suppose if someone is really paraniod, this might be an issue. However, they have someone at the front desk -- hours a day. As a matter of fact, when you go out, they ask that you give them your room key and they will give it back when you return. Unheard of in this day, but it was kind of cool because you get to know the front desk people and they get to know you. They will ask for ID if they don't recognize you, but otherwise, they'll just give you your key. Again, I suppose if someone is super paranoid, this might be an issue, but I felt very safe there - more safe than staying at a motel with outside entry in the middle of nowhere. 
Also, if you're not used to sleeping in a noisy city, I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The windows are super thin and you can hear traffic and people ALL NIGHT - it is only a couple of blocks from Time Square, so be prepared for traffic noise. I actually slept with a white noise track on my MP- player all night, and as soon as I dozed off, I didn't notice the noise anymore.

id10521,"My wife and I stayed one night at the fairly new JW Marriott in Indianapolis in mid-July. We normally stay at the Conrad what visiting Indy but decided to try out the new hotel. 
The hotel is over-sized - probably -X the size of the Conrad. Almost reminds one of a Vegas-style hotel. The styling of the hotel is very modern-eclectic - it stands in sharp contrast to the more conservative and traditional Conrad styling. I personally prefer the Conrad but I'm sure others will prefer the JW. The JW lobby is loud and busy - Conrad is quiet and reserved.
The service was generally pretty good - however, the luggage did take over -- minutes to get to the room. I finally went down stairs to retrieve the luggage at which point the bell man brought it up. We did not order room service or eat at the restaurants so we got little exposure to the service other than the valet, which was fine.
The room view was spectacular. We were on the top floor and had an end room - two walls with floor to ceiling glass. Amazing. This is one area that the Conrad can not complete with JW - the views. Otherwise, the room was like the lobby - more modern in design. The office chair looks like something from my parents --'s kitchen. Take note: the bathroom does NOT have a tub - least not in our room. Also, the room did not have a couch (which you get at the Conrad) although there is room for one. But overall the room was very nice, beds were comfortable.
The pool is very small - smaller than Conrad and I do not like the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""raised"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" design of the pool. Hot tub was nice sized and the excerise facility was very large. One area where the Conrad is obviously superior to the JW is the changing-shower facilities for the pools and excercise rooms. There is no comparison. Conrad feels like an exclusive golf club with dry-wet sauna, multiple showers, many free amenities etc. The JW feels like a public changing area with no saunas and few free amenities. The Conrad comes equipped with robes and they are nowhere in sight at the JW. 
The presence of a Starbucks in the meetings area is a nice feature.
Overall, the new JW is a great new hotel in Indy but my vote is still that Conrad is a distant first. If you are an executive used to high-end treatment, it's my opinion the JW probably will not quite satisfy like the Conrad.",Mozilla,Mobile,happy

Good location for me, but I don't know if I'd pick this spot if I was a tourist. It was nice to be near the food court at the Liberty Place and the other restaurants around within walking distance, but most of the tourist stuff wasn't around where I was located. 
The service was great. Everyone from the front door staff to the folks at the front desk to the people with guest services-room service were very nice. On a couple of different occasions, my room key failed to work, and the staff was great about having new cards programmed for me so I didn't have to wait too long. Prices through room service and down at the restaurant were a little steep, but probably not much different from other big cities. 
In general, I'd say room cleanliness was pretty good. There were a couple of questionable stains on the wall near the bed, as well as a couple on sheets-pillowcases on certain days. Also, there was one day where I found a wash cloth with a red spot. I tossed it on the floor, assuming housekeeping would replace it. The next day when I picked up a new wash cloth from the counter, I found another red spot...surprisinly similar to the one from the previous day. No proof it was indeed the same...but no proof it wasn't.
The heavenly beds are still pretty good...not as fantastic as I remember from my last Westin stay, but since I wasn't getting a ton of sleep at night anyway, it wasn't really mattering much.

Here's a idea, bathrooms are a tool for your stay they need to provide a function and when it's over designed for visual appeal it looses the function.

It is also in front of the of the shower handles and the shower door does not slide.

id10537,"We have stayed in the Charlotte area a number of times but never before at the Marriott City Center. The location suited our needs perfectly for this particular trip.
 The check-in and bellman staff was exceptionally courteous and quite efficient. The lobby was attractive and well-maintained. Self-parking in the garage is not difficult once you navigate the very sharp and narrow curve in the entrance ramp. It felt reasonably safe and well lit. Our room was a bit small but certainly clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced given our discount (AAA, AARP, and Marriott- sponsored packages all work out to pretty much the same weekend discount). 
BUT, and here is why I only rate our stay neutral and consider even that somewhat generous:
We were there on Friday and Saturday nights. Friday night we were awakened by extremely loud voices and laughter in the hallway right outside our room on an upper floor. I peeked out the security peephole and saw a group of well-dressed young people. they were calling to each other from doorway to doorway, down the hall, and generally behaving as though they were in a college dorm on a weekend night. I assume we were the unfortunate hallmates of people who had attended a very successful rehearsal dinner or other youth-oriented event where a lot of alcohol had been consumed and the reality of being in a grownup setting had been forgotten. I called the desk to complain and after five minutes the noise subsided somewhat, whether because the celebrants realized their behavior was unacceptable or because someone came up from the desk to tell them to be quiet I do not know.
Saturday night was much worse and something the hotel should have controlled. The relatively unobtrusive thumping music we had heard and ignored in the background Friday night had become a major annoyance, blasting up to our high-floor room for hours. We tried to go to sleep about --:--; it continued until after - a.m. Several times between - a.m. and - a.m. I called the desk and was told various things, among them that there had once been a club nearby that caused noise problems and the problem had just reappeared.... they were sending someone across the street to complain to the club...not clear if they were calling police, Not quite clear how many other people if any had called to complain this particular night, It was as loud as if we were on the street right outside the club--but keep in mind that not only were we on a high floor, we had our windows closed, and the air conditioning was on. 
I suppose that on a week night for business travelers the Marriott Ceity Center is still a viable option, but I don't know the club habits of Charlotte--perhaps even on a week night there might be an issue. Unless I were to be told with certainty that the club noise was no longer an issue I would not stay at this Marriott again despite its excellent location. I am also disappointed that although my husband included a comment about the excessive noise and poor response from staff in his response to the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how was your visit"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" survey he received upon our return home, we have received no reply or acknowledgment of any kind--nearly a month after the survey was returned.",Edge,Tablet,not happy

Room: The room was facing the garden, basically it faced a palm tree but it was ok, it provided good shade and kept the place cooler. All amenities were available in the room. Bathroom was ok.

Upon arrival a lady named Jane greeted me and gave me some tourist information and to to get around town with public transportation on a map.
I stayed for - days. My room was large clean , had a flat screen wall mounted Samsung tv.. Decent size. A little table , dresser closet, plenty of wall outlets for plug-in . large mirror also. bed was king size. lamps were nice , but still covered in plastic??The bathroom was nice , it had mirrors so you could see your backside, as well as watch tv in the mirror from the toilet.(lol)
 I usually stay fairly neat, and need little service from the maids. My biggest problem and one of the reasons they lose a star is because I placed the do not disturb sign up, and the maids still came in and cleaned. They did this - or - days in a row. If I pay for a room and place a sign up that says do not disturb, I expect them to respect it. The maid was Asian and spoke almost no English, so I assume she couldn't read the sign either. Right across the street is Brenda's soul food . There is never any wait for one person even if there is an hour wait. I brought two different friends by, and since the door locks to the elevator and she buzzes you in after she identifies you, she needs an I'd from any visitor's . This is a little bit of a hassle, and she reserves the right to refuse a guest from entrance. Although she didn't with me, she could possibly not like your guest and deny them entrance.

The bathroom also was very ready to have the floors ripped out and replaced with tile( they were linoleum.) albeit was kept clean.
Upon leaving I was running late for the train back to the airport. I asked the manager Jane when I was checking out if I could take a cab to the train would be better than walking - blocks. she calls a cab she knows, and she says yea it is too close. And starts to kind of lecture me that I should have left earlier( obviously I'm know ) I'm running late and need to pay and leave, but she is lecturing me still.

Pros: One of the better locations in downtown Austin. You're within reasonable walking distance of South Congress restaurants and trailers and the -th street entertainment district.

We reserved two rooms, an interior queen and a deluxe room. The queen, as expected, was very small although the decor made up for the size. The deluxe room had a 'view' but unfortunately our window looked into the scaffolding of the building across the street. When you stay there, request a higher floor (-rd or higher) facing the water.

A rate that includes parking is often a better option than a regular room rate (the packages also include breakfast etc). Fisherman's Wharf is one big tourist trap so the area is deserted at night.. but you can get to other neighborhoods quickly. Avoid eating in the area.. food is not great and charges are high. Snag a cab or the cable car to another neighborhood and get a great meal for a lot less.

Service at the Grand Hyatt was friendly, provided the staff weren't overwhelmed by crowds. They did automatically offer and accommodate a late checkout, a positive that seems to have become a trend with the chain for loyalty club members. The lobby was generally very busy and loud but not laid out or furnished in a manner to encourage people-watching. The hotel location is great if attending a convention and still pretty good for any other downtown or riverwalk activities with a few blocks of walking. The staff of the main restaurant were too flustered to acknowledge my presence at the time I tried to visit so I gave up and thus can't review the food. 
My room on the --th floor had a nice view but the furniture was a bit worn and about average for a business hotel and below average for a Hyatt though the style fit the Hyatt brand.
